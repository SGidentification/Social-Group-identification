it is being widely publicized , the tories have just had the whole 'brown is a dolt and does n't know his economics ' thrown back at them . its a shame really because they were half right labour economic policy was imprudent wrt lending , i just wish labour would move back to the left with their domestic security policies .	c05udrb	ukpolitics

cameron excels at attacking labour , and pointing out exactly where the government is going wrong . but does he have an actual alternative ? simon hoggart where one begins to lose him is when he retreats to generalities . he says that the first step to economic recovery is to fix our broken society '' . he makes it sound like something you 'd pop on the back on an envelope . buy milk , phone babysitter , fix broken society '' as if it was a dvd player that needed repairing . .. then we got onto empowering individuals '' , coherent public service reform '' , the new , postbureaucratic age '' and unlocking the potential of private and voluntary sectors '' , and we realised that he had little to offer except intangible blairish aspirations . but it did n't matter . the news channels had long moved on .

sunder katwala , general secretary of the fabian society gave a robust rebuttal of this . saying that things have changed and implying that trevor phillips was behind the times . sunder was very impressive actually a future pm ? or has the experience with tony blair put the uk off smooth talkers ? i think obama would have had to get a lot more detailed on policy to get through here , after so many people found that tb did not deliver .	c0697ax	ukpolitics
no , it 's just the best summary of the article i cooked up . the article does n't talk about the margins in terms of percentages , hence i merely regurgitated it as concisely as i could . yes , if you want to analyse it in terms of percentages , you can look at it differently . however , it seems that the normal way to talk about margins is in terms of the absolute number , not percentage points . dunno why , but that 's just the way i stuck with it .	c069p37	ukpolitics

you 're viewing all of the above with western eyes . without wanting to appear condescending , reading something like edward said 's orientalism '' might make you think twice about patronising former colonies by suggesting that we 'civilised ' them by imposing our world onto theirs . the fact that english is a world language is n't necessarily good sure , it 's good for lazy brits who go abroad and never have to experiment by speaking a local language , but it 's a weakened our claim as 'owners ' of english now that countries like india have more native speakers of it than we do , and b it 's causing the death of indigenous languages all over the world a huge loss to mankind 's heritage . slavery was ended under colonialism what ? ! after colonialism started it ? then that 's okay . i 'm not saying the empire was 100 bad i agree with your train point , but the few positives in no way make up for the huge mess the whole thing is . finally , how was it not an occupation ? we moved into someone else 's country , deposed their leaders , and set up our own systems . i 'd call that an occupation .	c06lahr	ukpolitics

just because hubbert was wrong about that 50 years ago , does n't mean that peak oil predictions are necessarily wrong today . you can do a statistical analysis of reported oil discoveries and project a trend . in all likelihood , new oilfield discoveries are n't going to be enough to significantly affect the timing of global conventional peak oil . what 's interesting about this latest news is that the iea have previously dismissed nearterm peak oil predictions as being unfounded . it 's on the basis of their previous report that the british government has made absolutely no contingency planning for peak oil . so i believe that this represents conventional opinion on peak oil starting to shift radically . i 'm just repeating what 's in the article in this paragraph , of course .	c06un7v	ukpolitics

why should this be illegal in any way shape or form ? it should n't but we do n't actually know what has happened yet , so at this point it is all speculation . for example the rumour is that information about how labuor mp 's were going to vote on specific issues relating to the home office was passed to the opposition . if this information came from the home office as a result of polling the mp 's thats fine , if it came from a civil servant working in the whips office , or from information discussed in the cabinet office then it is not depending on how it was sourced it is more akin to industrial espionage . so in short what is missing at present is the specifics , i can envision a rather large number of scenarios that would put the police and government in the right , and quite a few that would do the opposite , until this information comes out everything is speculation .	c06ldkl	ukpolitics

yes , it does seem from the known facts which are annoying vague at this juncture that the nature of the arrest was overly heavy handed but that 's a separate issue from whether green should be above the law if suspected of an offence the torygraph and the dailymail would be bleating just as irritatingly if the police had turned up at his office with a mug of hot cocoa . the latest that i 've heard is that green was suspected of procuring information on how home office ministers were to vote on bills not sure what the right to privacy is regarding that .	c06lkee	ukpolitics

new labour politicians are so fucking unbelievable . the 'culture of cynicism and despair ' is n't caused by bloggers and their unwillingness to 'add value ' it 's caused by political choice in the united kingdom having reached something of a nadir , with all three major british political parties becoming nothing more than three shades of conservatism , offering nothing of any worth to the common man . it 's caused by a complete lack of understanding from the british political class which becomes more and more detached from the real world by the day of the problems that the people on the united kingdom face , leading to nothing but halfimplementation of harebrained policies that solve nothing .	c067ufs	ukpolitics

i ca n't figure out when these will be useful . given that police officers must use minimal force , when would they be empowered to use their stun guns ? they would n't be going up against individuals armed with firearms that will still be a job for firearms officers , any other weapon would not pose a threat at any distance great enough to warrant a shot from a taser , a situation where pepper spray or a truncheon would be more appropriate . all i can see this doing is increasing public distrust of the police , destroying the tradition of having officers on patrol not being routinely armed , increasing the number of inappropriate uses of force by the police and increasing the legal costs the police face in litigation .	c06ibxk	ukpolitics

it was out of order , the police officers should be dealt with , but looking at the cctv footage it was n't exactly a case of three cops deciding to give someone a hard time . looking at the early part of it you can infer and no one is claiming any differently that the drunk starts yelling abuse at the police who are looking for someone of a similar description as the drunk for a separate offense the police move towards him , he runs away and falls over about 5 meters later , they catch up with him , he gets a bit aggressive , they restrain him in a reasonable manner , he then bites one of the police officers . up until this point i would say the trouble being caused is 100 of the drunks making , however at that point the special constable i.e . part time volunteer type officer starts laying into the guy . that is utterly out of order , and pretty much inexcusable in a legal sense although i can sort of understand why he would do it . then they hold him until someone arrives to pick him up . it is news worthy , but the 'veteran ' element has no bearing on it frankly he should have been charged with assault and a breach of the peace , the special constable is also in the wrong , assault should cover it . the other two ? well it depends rather heavily on what they said in court and how much effort they put into protecting the special . in any case , i do n't see it as a case of three cops beating up a drunk in the street in the middle of the night just because they could '' more a case of one drunk provoking a reaction , attacking some officers , one of whom then goes way over the top in retaliation , presumably because the uniform makes him feel invincible . quite a few wrongs on both sides if you ask me , but of course the police should be held to a higher standard .	c06lkh9	ukpolitics

i shuold point out that the government argument on this is so unbelievably tenuous that i ca n't believe they actually tried it . their logic was that holding this extra data from people innocent of any crimes would help to detect perpetrators of future crimes . now , firstly this suggests that the government feels those found innocent of crimes in the past are actually criminals who 'got away with it ' , personally i think that even for our current home office minister that is a little harsh . secondly , claiming that having more data from more people will help solve crime should lead the government to the conclusion that having dna data from everyone is a good idea . from a purely police perspective this is probably even true and defensible arguments about dna fallibility aside but then it would be political suicide much as equipping everyone with one of those gps tag things would be . so it seems the governments previous position was simply that as they could get away with holding the data of innocent but in their opinion shady people they would do . so this is a rather massive fail for the labour government , and probably another indication that the uk needs to move away from 'new ' labour back to 'old ' labour if it were just possible to bring the middle classes along for the ride of course .	c06nzvk	ukpolitics

if they deny it , it 's true . if they strenuously deny it , it 's very true and too close to the bone . the home secretary did not deny the future requirement of having to show id when buying a mobile phone and it being recorded on a national database , as the original article stated URL '' whitehall officials have raised the idea of a register containing the names and addresses of everyone who buys a phone in recent talks with vodafone and other telephone companies , insiders say. '' the move aims to close a loophole in plans being drawn up by gchq , the government s eavesdropping centre in cheltenham , to create a huge database to monitor and store the internet browsing habits , email and telephone records of everyone in britain . the big brother database would have limited value to police and mi5 if it did not store details of the ownership of more than half the mobile phones in the country . '' jackboot jacqui the mad home secretary states that '' unless we take action we will lose the capability to obtain communications data . this is a serious issue which requires a serious response '' so she has admitted that she will require a national database of everyone 's phone number , to go along with the national database of every person URL , a national database of your every car journey URL , and a national database of your every email , telephone call , text message and web page visited URL .	c065e4s	ukpolitics

your opposition appears to be with regard to the tv license , which of course is your prerogative , although it should be noted that the bbc is n't the only tv channel in receipt of license funds . to address your specific points though , how do you measure the success of an organisation like the bbc ? by the quality o its output and the satisfaction of its viewers . in both cases the bbc appears to be very successful in most areas . if private companies had the sort of funding provided to the bbc then perhaps we would see even better programmes ? looking at the 19931998 budget figures for itv and the bbc it would seem that both have similar levels of funding , of course it is hard to compare the two given that the bbc provides rather more programming in more media . as to whether we would see better programmes , i have no idea why we would ? and in terms of value wasted the sums in the bbc may be larger than mps though not banks . for example jonathan ross 18m contract ... assuming this is a competitive deal then a private company would have paid the same . i would suggest that it would be hard to determine what is waste , although of course the bbc budget is several times the amount paid to directly to mp 's . as to jonathon ross , as much as i dislike the shows he is in , if his contract is competitive that is all that matters . why should a taxpayer who does not like jr contribute to paying him 18m ? the taxpayer has many things s he would rather not pay for . as to the bbc specifically , it provides a fantastic service and is generally value for money , the government who we elect and who represent us seem happy to have it exist as it does , indeed polling swings but generally there does not seem to show a large majority of people who want to see the bbc scrapped , at most as far as i can see about 30 of any given poll want the bbc funded without any taxpayer support and between 30 and 50 support the current method although many think that bbc spending is wasteful . personally i put the bbc in the same category as the nhs , it is something that is important and something i would fight to maintain .	c0b3lfs	ukpolitics

if that is the shining opportunity then i want no part in it . the idea that the government has been indulging in a '' a decade of waste , overborrowing and mismanagement in the public sector . is simply not true , it is of course the official line of the conservative party . yes the uk should live within its means , and the criticism of overborrowing is an accurage one , the only accurate one on a practical level . the government should be using taxation to meet its public service obligations , it should then try to spend the money it receives sensibly . if you ask the conservative party today where they will cut the 'waste ' out of the budget , the answer is invariably non specific , they will simply remove the waste , spend less but provide the same , if not more in terms of services . that does n't make sense . if the conservative party turned around and said that they would cut borrowing my increasing taxation , pay down the national debt and get rid of things that are wasteful in terms of service provision id cards for one , the results of privatisation in some areas as another then they would have a point and quite likely my vote . but they do n't and will not . as to who the markets will praise and be happy with and those the markets will be angry with , well , frankly i really do n't care . the uk should aim at ensuring a minimum standard of living for people within the uk , the provision of a minimum level of service , health , housing , education , defence and justice , no more no less . it should set sensible interest rate targets , provide sensible support and tax structures and protect the interests of the people . after the mess that the banks have allowed us go get into , and the government allowed the banks to get into accompanied by loud cheering from all sides i think we can be sure that having a government trust the private sector with things that the government has a duty to provide is a bad idea .	c08bi5l	ukpolitics

the problem is the main parties only ever copy each other 's policies and basically say , we will do the exact same things ... only better . so , uh , vote for us '' . that 's not true on absolutely every issue . for example the lib dems say the iraq war was illegal and wrong . the tories at most say it was a mistake , and they say that absolutely disingenuously because they also say they would have gone to war as well based on the evidence or should i say , socalled evidence available at the time . the lib dems want a fairer voting system , like we have in devolved government elections in scotland , wales and northern ireland , for the house of commons labour and the tories are dead against that all for blatantly selfinterested reasons obviously , but still , if you support a fairer voting system , that 's one reason in favour of voting lib dem . the labour government has made a big thing about stimulating the economy with increased public spending whereas the tories say they want to cut spending . but i take your point on many issues you are right they are jockeying for the same socalled centre ground '' . you have to go beyond what they say and look at other evidence as well , like their record . and that does lead to a clearer picture of the differences , in my opinion .	c09iozt	ukpolitics
i totally agree , but i also know that this will never be as it never has been allowed to be the case ... i have just read the voice of the people '' , george galloway 's comments regarding the scalp '' of michael martin , and i see it as nothing more than an emotionally manipulating ploy to shift attention away from the expenses scandal '' by manipulating sympathetic reactions to martin 's resignation . i have always thought of george galloway tremendously eloquent and emotive speaker though he may be when he wants to be and his ilk as being establishment figures , whose job is to make it look , and to make the ordinary people '' feel , as though the ordinary people have a voice against the establishment , and he continually reinforces thismy opinion . no scalping '' was done on martin ... witness the retirement package '' that this man will walk away with , despite his efforts to avert investigation of mp 's expenses , even to the extent of bringing in the police , not to confront the wrongdoers , but , rather , to find out who could be punnished for making it clear to the public what the public had evey right to have openly made clear to them . his resignation , i believe , has been politically coreographed to the finest detail witness the apparent bumbling '' of this highly experienced politition on monday , when he repeatedly had to refer to the clerks '' . do they really think that we are all so naive as not to see what 's going on . throughout his excusings , brown continually stated that the system requires to be overhauled and the fact that he used the expression , the system '' in almost every sentence demonstrated a fairly crude psychological ploy particularly when he hardly mentioned the term mp the system needs to be cleaned up we will change the system so that this can t happen again it is the system that has lost the confidence of the people etc. , etc. , he told us , and , in his doing this , i perceive a deliberate attempt to divert attention from the fact that it has been mp s who abused the system , and not the system that abused the system . stating that the system will be changed so that this can not happen again , does he not acknowledge that the mp s themselves can not be trusted to adhere to the spirit of the rules he did say that parliament can no longer operate as a gentleman 's club ... so , what is it to become ... even more than it apparently is , a charlatan 's club ? ? if mp 's could be so trusted , then , surely a simple cease and desist from himself and the other party leaders would have sufficed . and , in this , he accentuates my earlier point mp s admittedly , apparently not all have proven themselves to be abusers of the current system . they have been duplicitous , greedy , or , at best although i find it most difficult to accept negligent , in their abuse of the system . when duplicitous even if only morally duplicitous people are made to work under a new system , they will only find ways to subvert and abuse the new system is it not reasonable to so think ? . dismissals , debarment from all future public office or future negotiations on others ' behalf with public offices , and full and open prosecutions are what is required ! ! ! of course , that wo n't happen , and only a few minnows '' will be brought to book . but , this may also very well be among many other things .. the thin end of the wedge '' , allowing outside influences to influence parliament . as to the independent '' vetting of mp 's salaries and expenses , i am reminded of it 's having been said by one of the rothschilds , was it ? give me control of a nation 's money , and it matters not who is in government '' . well , the same applies to control of mp 's income money give me control of the mp 's income , and it matters not which party has the majority in parliament '' . it is the start of the process of surrendering what is left of the independence of parliament to independent '' masters , and the end of a long , contrived , process . at least , so i think ...	c09p1ix	ukpolitics

well my educated guess from my lifetime of exposure is that pockets of these do exist . people seem to get defensive as they think it 's some indictment on all of britain . i 've had racial abuse in cases where i was the biggest strongest guy there . most notably at uni during a basketball game where we were playing some backwards twits from an raf base in leicestershire and i happened to be the only black player on my team that day . i 'd understand if i was the best player there that day and they wanted to get me off my game , but that was n't the case ... it was blatant and the ref who felt powerless at the time had to apologise to me after the game . it just strikes me as odd that people seem to feel these people are looked at as chav scum , with no virtues and most likely to cause trouble ... but the one thing we can be sure of is they are culturally and racially aware and probably not racist . criminal , feral , troublemakers ... but also racially sensitive . come on .	c0eoxvk	ukpolitics

the problem as i see it with your stance is that you assign rights to groups . rights are of the individual , and by assigning rights to groups you remove rights from individuals . as race is still taboo , let me change to the example of the religious b b owner and the same sex couple . the religious b b owner believes that her gods do not like same sex marriage and therefore does not let same sex couples stay in their b b . the same sex couple believe they have the right to stay at the b b . in order to stay they exert their group right , but violate the freedom of expression and property rights of the owner .	c0eoqb2	ukpolitics

my view is that the democratic system is a scam adopted because the less subtle rule of royal families stopped being a feasible way for the elites to run their countries . i tend to disagree , primarily because of both how the change from direct rule by a monarch to a parliamentary democracy came about and also because of the changes that have been brought since , all of which have diluted and changed who is in power . yes democracy can be seen as a way to legitimise political tyranny , in some places it is look at china or north korea but not in places that we see as functional democracies . our country is run by big businesses , corporations , the super rich . it is n't though is it ? big businesses and the super rich are perfectly capable of influencing the electorate and pushing policy in certain directions , but they often do n't get their way . in fact money has much less of an impact on uk politics than it does in other places i 'd like to see it removed from the equation all together , but do n't see a sensible way to achieve that yet . i would actually argue that media ownership is more important in this than any direct political power , after all it is the media that sets the agenda for 90 of the populations political thinking . parliamentary democracy is a front to keep the consumer happy , to feel involved enough in what 's going on , to feel that the right to buy louis vuitton fake handbags and a range rover is enough to be happy . there is certainly an element of this , although i think that you may find that the reverse is actually true . governments must push to make sure people can buy louis vuitton fake handbags and a range rover to stay in power , sadly it is what a large number of people aspire to . you just wrote a comment that could have come out of a citizenship class in school , it 's interesting , i never took any 'citizenship ' classes in school , i rather think that they have no place there . then again , making good argument is not particularly useful because you will go on thinking what you think and i will go on thinking what i think its called a discussion , i will readily take in any view that you have that i feel is right , i would also happily change my position where i feel it is wrong , after all , there is no benefit of holding a position that is clearly wrong . i suspect you believe what you read in newspapers and listen to pmqs with the kind of attention of someone who thinks it means something more than eastenders . well yes and no , i read newspapers and take a lot of what is being reported in , believing in something on the basis that it is in print is not something i tend to find myself doing . as to pmqs , i occasionally watch , but more for the entertainment value that parliamentary politics provides , rather than any belief that the people doing the debating will suddenly solve all our ills , or even that the debate in question is important in itself , it is after all the process that is important . i take you for naive . i take you as someone overly cynical . apparently to the point where you become part of the problem rather than the solution . i am politically rather left wing , part of the traditional left if you like , although in some very few areas my positions would probably be seen as rather right wing mostly in areas of defence . i realise that no single party represents me , indeed i find it hard to find a mainstream political party that goes even half way to claiming the same positions that i do . i do however think that this is a product of ideological bankruptcy on the part of the parties , a lust for votes rather than any true purpose . the problem is that this has led to apathy , and that apathy has led to the shirking of ideological positions even further to engage the apathetic . the only way for there to be any change in the status quo is to ensure that we are involved if we can be , and that those we elect speak for us , not those who can make the most general promises to the largest number of groups . the media again is part of this , they should be in a position to inform , not pick a side and then attack the other . i do n't want to hurt your feelings or disparage you as a human being . i do n't mind if you do , about the only thing that i find annoying is the statement of views like the ones that you have made above without any additional commentary . apathy is part of the problem , simply claiming that no one represents , or is able to represent you and so there is nothing to be done is one reason why we ca n't tell the tories from labour in so many areas on the national stage any more , why should they care if voters do n't vote for them if they wo n't vote for someone else ? in that instance it is not a loss to them , it is something they can shrug off . there is at present a national consensus on some areas of policy , with those areas of common ground it is easy for politicians to retreat to somewhere where everyone , or almost everyone will support them , it is the other areas , the areas of difference , that must be highlighted . you know my arguments already . if you were inclined to agree , you would n't be defending the rulers , you would n't believe you can have an impact on the nation by participating in electoral democracy . i do n't agree with your theory relating to the purpose of a democracy , nor do i feel that i am defending the rulers . i will however say that the system allows for and can be used to affect change , but only if people want it . at present it seems that anger is something hard to create and sustain , something that the media rouses up on cue , but drops with the next big story . our parliamentary system works , or can work . at present it is broken because people do n't care , but it is only through that system that we will be able to make changes again in future , assuming that we are ever in a position where sufficient people agree that change is necessary so it comes down to media again ... . that 's not to poo pooh having an impact on the parking regulations or your council tax do we have an influence on that ? are my neighbours really for the ongoing increases in council tax ? we did n't , although as to your neigbours , it is quite possible that they are for an increase in council services . actually given my involvement in local politics it would seem that most people again , do n't care , and you have a small number of 'concerned ' people , generally the same people , who have all the influence because they participate . no one wants to pay more in taxes , but they do want cctv cameras to keep the youths away , or the road resurfaced , or the roundabout landscaped . i do n't know how to answer this . viability and popularity mean nothing . the idea of acting for the popular view , the 51 is screwed up . the 51 is convinced by demagogery . demagogery wins in a democracy . not good or wise or sane . it 's about informing people , the system allows change , it is n't swayed toward anything . what is needed is the media , something that the internet is making more accessible and why people like rupert murdoch are scared . my problem is that i know my views are in the minority , even with all the money in the world , and all the media coverage i would n't get 51 of people in the country supporting me . i am sure however that a largish number would and that that leverage would make it possible for a compromise to be achieved , that is the best anyone should be able to hope for anything more and you have a tyranny , even if it is one you can support ... . sorry , rambling somewhat .	c09ilsk	ukpolitics

there 's a very good piece in the wsj faced with public finances spiraling out of control , chancellor alistair darling needed to use this budget to reassure the financial markets that britain had a credible plan to reduce the national debt . instead , this was a nakedly political budget entirely designed to gull voters ahead of an election due within the next year . the result is a shambles that will impress no one . faced with a similar collapse in its public finances and a potential loss of international investor confidence , the irish government bit the bullet , introducing sharp tax rises , steep cuts to public spending and savage cuts to public sector pay .

but they certainly do n't use it as a platform or indeed appear to let it impact on the policy positions that they put forward . they 've both been told not to mention religion in public . alistair campbell , blair 's famous spin doctor , helped see to that . but it did impact blair 's decisions . the reason for the proliferation of faith schools is one , the other was the war in iraq . listen to the man now , everything he does is guided by his religious views . he makes bush sound like an atheist ! i ca n't find it , but i did read an article about brown 's insistence on the hard line against pot coming from his religious views . it 's certainly had an impact with regards to the nutt incident . maybe the government 's disdain for science in general is due to the views of its religious leaders . do n't underestimate the lobbying power of religious institutions . clever lobbying can make up for a lack of popular support amongst the people . just watch the recent documentary URL on channel 4 .	c0g6r2m	ukpolitics

mate , as a dyed in the wool socialist and former labour party member , even i can see that some of the positions that labour has taken are wrong . wrong for the country and wrong in terms of what labour stands for . we are in a position now where labour could make some changes for the better , reverse some of the policies that are damaging to civil liberties , id cards , dna database , some of the antiterror legislation , and some of the criminal justice legislation . it would n't be a bad thing . that said , i do n't think the uk is even close to being a police state and i 'd love to see you find me saying that it is ... , however i do n't think it should take the uk being a police state to make people stop and think about where we are and what is n't right .	c0alwrm	ukpolitics
the conservatives , in the middle of their annual party conference where they have so far focussed on cutting public spending , said they would repeal the human rights act and replace it with a british bill of rights to rebalance laws in favour of protecting the public . justice minister jack straw defended the human rights act , saying the names and addresses of offenders were already on the public record and police regularly named wanted criminals . he said he aimed to put information about offenders on neighbourhood policing websites this autumn . i cant believe they have the balls to try this again . i laughed my arse off when cameron was on paxman and said he wanted to repeal the human rights act and paxman asked him if he thought being chucked out of the eu was a good idea and cameron looked blank . paxman had to explain to him that signing up to eu human rights is a non negotiable part of being and the eu and that repealing it meant you were automatically chucked out and rightly so . he stammered something about coming to an arrangement with the rest of the eu and paxman just slowly nailed him again by saying that every other nation that had tried most recently turkey wanted opt outs for things like women s rights had not even had the chance to discuss it . it was nonnegotiable . still , why embarrass yourself once when you can do it twice ? and on the whole offender thing if someone is still dangerous they should not be released . if they are not then you have no business naming them as they are the same as any other citizen . so the only reason we would need to name them is if we are routinely releasing dangerous people . that sound like a much bigger danger to me than the human rights act , which , i figure , i could probably take in a fair fight .	c0e46ny	ukpolitics

sorry . i am lazy . i am not attacking either . i do take you for naive though . do n't be upset . my view is that the democratic system is a scam adopted because the less subtle rule of royal families stopped being a feasible way for the elites to run their countries . our country is run by big businesses , corporations , the super rich . parliamentary democracy is a front to keep the consumer happy , to feel involved enough in what 's going on , to feel that the right to buy louis vuitton fake handbags and a range rover is enough to be happy . you just wrote a comment that could have come out of a citizenship class in school , your teacher would give you good marks because they are trained to pass on some approved info to you and have you regurgitate it back . i am crap , i ca n't give you a good intellectual argument plus i have been lazing about all day and am getting a bit of entertainment on reddit and the same old stuff is irritating me . i express that irritation but i am quite clearly not particularly good at making a good argument . then again , making good argument is not particularly useful because you will go on thinking what you think and i will go on thinking what i think unless you can say something really thought provoking but all you do is write a fairly competent school report . i suspect you believe what you read in newspapers and listen to pmqs with the kind of attention of someone who thinks it means something more than eastenders . i take you for naive . i believe that you argue what you do due to that . i do n't want to hurt your feelings or disparage you as a human being . i am too lazy to try to construct an empirical explanation of why i think that is so . that would be a difficult academic exercise , i am not here for that . you know my arguments already . if you were inclined to agree , you would n't be defending the rulers , you would n't believe you can have an impact on the nation by participating in electoral democracy . that 's not to poo pooh having an impact on the parking regulations or your council tax do we have an influence on that ? are my neighbours really for the ongoing increases in council tax ? if you ca n't drum up enough people , then obviously your position is n't that viable or popular ... i do n't know how to answer this . viability and popularity mean nothing . the idea of acting for the popular view , the 51 is screwed up . the 51 is convinced by demagogery . demagogery wins in a democracy . not good or wise or sane .	c09ikbo	ukpolitics

iain martin wrote an interesting piece on this parliamentary allowances and mps expenses have absolutely nothing , zilch , zero , to do with the prime minister , or indeed the government . at least they should n't have if we are to have what this country has traditionally enjoyed parliamentary democracy in which parliament is sovereign . the rights of parliament are at issue here . the government governs only with parliamentary approval government owes its authority to parliament , not the other way round . that is the best defence of our liberties we have or at least it would be if more than a handful of mps understood the distinction and constitutional proprieties . brown 's only involvement should be as one among 646 mps as pm he should not be announcing a reform programme of members allowances . yes , of course the rules on mps expenses need to change . but that is for mps and the house authorities to resolve without the interference of ministers who want to issue parliament orders to distract attention from the slow death of their government .

i 've just come across a piece in the evening standard , that seems relevant to this the reason new labour has always acted in a thuggish manner is because it was founded on an absence of ideals . it was created by blair and brown , by mandelson and alastair campbell , as a vehicle for gaining power . nothing more , nothing less . they had watched in horror as the conservatives dominated the stage in the 1980s . they vowed they would do whatever it took to get to downing street . since 1997 , their every working day has been based around the task of prolonging their term of office . it is what drives them all when they wake up in the morning . it fills in the hollow . sure , we can all point to various changes for the better , but as a check list for 12 years of virtually untrammelled power , it is deeply disappointing . and they know it . their anger is not manufactured it is deeply ingrained and directed at anyone who criticises them . i would suspect although psychologists would have a better understanding than i that deep down it is directed at themselves . what is so frustrating is that those few mps , and the odd minister , who do have strong principles and deep ambitions to change britain felt forced to hide them . they began to look and sound like automatons in order to avoid ritual humiliation at the hands of the prime minister 's henchmen for speaking out of turn . all that remains now is a fight for the scraps . labour does still contain the odd radical , such as jon cruddas , the tireless mp for dagenham and former deputyleadership contender . he and his small band are trying to put some steel in his party 's spine . meanwhile , ed balls , harriet harman , james purnell , the two milibands all instrumental in the new labour project now protest their radicalism . in so doing , they provide perfect targets for tory mockery . as for brown , he has no money , or political capital , to spend .

i was sort of summarizing expected behaviour you 're right , there is no explicit smallparty pool . what happens with d'hondt as i understand it ! is that the topscoring party takes the first seat of the constituency , and effectively has 16.7 or whatever percentage points knocked off its score . then the next topscoring party is evaluated , and they then have 16.7 knocked off , and so on , until the final seat . at this point , any party who polled less than 16.7 obviously wo n't have had any knocked off , so it is a contest between all of those parties scoring under that score presuming that any remaining remainder from a major party is small this is not always the case but if you look at the vote distribution in the past , it 's pretty rare for a party to take more than a couple of seats and maths sorta suggests that they will average only 8 remainder after all their seats are taken . so , in this situation , a vote for a party near the bnp will increase that party 's chances of being the highestscoring loser . on the other hand , a vote for a party lower than the bnp means that there is more likely to be a 2seat remainder after all of the parties with multiples of 16.7 have been accounted for in this case , a party scoring as the secondhighest loser will actually gain a seat your vote for a minor party actually makes it more likely that the bnp would get a chance at getting a seat . like i say , this is only based on my reading of the system i am not a mathematician or an electoral expert !	c0a28wx	ukpolitics

had to happen . here 's what we should to hope for now 1 they make this work . for electoral reform to happen , and to happen properly both the lib dems and the tories have to prove that they can play nice . if they ca n't , then that 's a pretty solid argument against reform that the tories and labour can to take to the nation , the lib dems will get kicked out and it 's back to business as usual for the labservatives . they need to show that collaboration can yeild great results , and that electoral reform will only improve this . 2 the lib dems can temper the worst aspects of toryism . they need to take on the far right of the tories . make it clear to the far right tory old gaurd that if they 're not willing to work with the lib dems they should fuck off and join ukip . make sure the spending cuts are sensible and targeted , not ideological and vindictive . 3 that labour get their shit together out of office . political parties become rotten and corrupt when they 've been in office too long . the libservatives have just inherited a massive bucket of shit to deal with , and labour can use their time out of office to remake themselves into a party worth supporting . purge themselves of the worst parts of blairismbrownism and become a genuine voice for the left wing . then maybe we 'll get some political discourse in this country worth listening to . edit 4 the tories and the lib dems generally opposed the worst of labour 's civil liberties abuses . they need to make good on that shit right fucking now .	c0pt1t9	ukpolitics
other than that i think labour have been pretty good . i ca n't argue with most of these points . the terrorism stuff in particular has been a fucking disgrace . however most of these things would also have been done with gusto by the tories as well . and the tories would have done it all without the marginally redeeming policies i mentioned above . i mean , you talk about labour punishing the poor without mentioning that the tories a scrapped the wages councils in the 80s , b voted against the national minimum wage and c tried again to scrap the nmw last year . i could go on , but i think we kind of agree . i know it 's unpalatable , but labour are miles ahead of the tories whichever way you cut it . my voting strategy is to keep the tories out at whatever cost , and vote for better parties whenever possible europe , devolved parliaments , local councils	c0mvlm8	ukpolitics

at the time things were not fine . the economy was on the up but it was week after week of scandal , much like it is now . major sold us up the river on maastricht , as brown did on lisbon . the recession major presided over i 'd say was as bad as the current shitstorm not because it was genuinely worse than this recession 'will be ' but was worse than it is so far . i remember the last recession quite well and i remember double digit inflation and mass unemployment . i remember things being much better in the south than the north i moved from north to south not long after the recession hit but still went back up north regularly . the erm helped us get out but it was n't better overnight . i remember the continuous shooting in the foot action from the tories telling the electorate that they 're stupid which while true is n't really what you should be going for around election time and the infighting between them . what i have seen is a recurring theme where the longer a government stays in power the worse it gets . in my living memory this happened with thatcher , major and blair brown started off fairly bad and continues to do even worse so it 's not fair to include him as he has n't completed a term . lots of things were started by the tories in the 80s and 90s , privatisation of british nationalised industries in some cases fair enough , perhaps not so great a deal overall in others , the criminal justice act could be considered the thinnest end of the wedge that is our civil liberties being destroyed although labour really have turned it into an art form . smears and the end of cabinet government really started to take off in thatcher 's administration although again it took labour to really take it to new depths . i loved it when the tories lost in 97. i stayed up to watch the election , it was the first one i voted in and it was a landslide because the tories , for all their economic recovery needed to go after all the recession started under a tory administration in the first place . the current lot need to go too , but regardless of what happens the recession will be much worse than anything this country 's experienced since the end of the napoleonic war . and as for publicly fellating george bush , i have n't seen that video , although i do agree the mental image is more disturbing than major and curry . thankyou for destroying my fragile little mind	c0lrl72	ukpolitics

nazism is a fascist system , where the corporations control the state.your belief only confirms what i am saying here about people being deliberately mislead into thinking that the nazi 's were socialist . it was n't ig faben that decided to setup death camps or invade poland . the problem with socialists is that they think socialism is always good . your belief only confirms what i am saying here about people being deliberately mislead into thinking that the nazi 's were socialist . definition socialism refers to any one of various economic theories of economic organization advocating state or cooperative ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods ... or an economic system in which the basic means of production are primarily owned and controlled collectively , usually by government under some system of central planning . there is a monumental difference between their far right policies and those of the left . far right and left are relatively meaningless in a discussion like this it is an outdated descriptor that attempts to measure two variables on one axis . however to play the game i accept that nazism was a more 'right wing ' form of socailsim , although more 'leftist ' forms of socialism were just as authoritarian .	c0jgrf0	ukpolitics

i do n't think the military will need more investment . depends on operational tempo . howver what we will end up with is a reduced number of deployable troops on an increased operational tempo for at least the next 6 years.. . jobs are being cut by 17k , so we lose the people who want to go , those that have had enough . you then do n't replace them thus burning people out more quickly ... as the economy recovers the military starts looking less attractive and is already under strength ... suddenly you have to attract new people , possibly with incentives to make up on the loss of operational efficiency . then we can add the cost of helicopters and maintainance that has been pushed back . all that across three services ... this will probably lead to both public and opposition outcries which people seem to listen to more when the tories are in opposition ... and a need to suddenly spend billions just to keep the capabilities we have at that point and likely billions more to bring us back to 2009 levels ... while much of labour 's spending was necessary investment , a lot was inefficiently utilised e.g . spent via dodgy pfi contracts and some was unnecessary or downright counterproductive e.g . iraq , afghanistan , the war on terror '' . i agree on both . however what we are seeing now is a direct spin off of infrastructure into the private sector . you will end up with the government either having to pay directly to the private sector to maintain services and probably subsidise them or rebuild the lost capability which the priate sector wo n't like if it is profitable . spending could easily have been managed so as to leave a surplus in the boom times , but sadly it was n't . war spending could have and there were mistakes , but the war was , stupidly , supported by all . however i would say that most of the other issues in spending related to attempts to use free market mechanisms or private contractors to do jobs that the goverment had gotten rid of , apparently because it would be cheaper and now it costs 500 to move a computer , or install a printer ... . what we are seeing now is the same writ large and likely something that will need to be repaired at some point in the future..	c166m05	ukpolitics

here 's a thought , why do n't we see what voters intentions are in 2015 ! you know , on election day , when people actually vote . i seem to recall the libdems polling 13 in 2009 and then astronomically high during the campaign but they only managed to increase their percentage of the popular vote from 2005 levels by a couple of percent in the end . then on the other end of the scale the tories had a massive lead in the polls in 2009 and were going to win by a land slide but come election day , that did n't materialise and it 's not like they even particularly did anything good or bad .	c18pl3y	ukpolitics

i 'm actually going to copy your post into notepad and keep it for future viewing when i 'm discussing this kind of thing . it 's one of the most level headed responses to the problem that i 've seen in a long while . i honestly ca n't agree enough . i do n't want to see those without money to support themselves their families be pushed further into poverty because there 's nothing to help them and with the ailing economy , that encompasses a lot more than it used to . however i do think the entire system should be revamped to work on a case by case basis . it might take a while longer but the pay off is that each person is helped back into work and those that are making false claims are soon caught and excluded from doing so again . a harsh lesson incentive here would simply be to lose the right to claim any kind of benefit for the five years following your being caught . hopefully that 'd be enough to give such people pause for thought . i also think that benefits should scale with your income and situation . as you say the conservatives may look after their core voters a little better than everyone else to ensure their future vote . that 's wrong . simply put the greater your overall income taking into account your family situation etc . the less in care you 'll be entitled to . hopefully things will move in this direction , although i 'm not entirely confident about that .	c0pt5zf	ukpolitics

absolutely yes URL , and here is one of the hit pieces URL on him because of it . farage openly identifies as a libertarian , though i do think he 's still on the learning curve , especially with the whole burka ban thing which i think is lord pearson 's baggage . it could well have been clegg who undertook the task of telling the truth because as i 've mentioned on this thread , the war on drugs is an information war and it can only be won at election time by people like farage telling the truth . clegg supporters will tell you that if their god told it like it is , he would fail to attain proper godhood which he needs to end the war on drugs . no he does n't , this is bullshit and clegg is full of shit . he could n't do anything even if he is pm without the support of labour or the conservatives and that he has none because he has n't made this a deal breaker . take electoral reform for example , that 's his deal breaker and both labour and the conservatives are prepared for it each in their own way , brown or his successor will concede and the cameron definitely will not . we know this because clegg has articulated his position very well and going forward there will be real progress on this . another thing i 've mentioned on this thread is that a politician 's position on drug prohibition tells you everything you need to know about them . any politician who thinks it is a legitimate function of government to regulate what its citizens put in their bodies is a tyrant . forget what he is as a politician , he is a bad as a person because there are 100s thousands ill , broke andor locked up . we do n't want bad people as leaders .	c0p4x1z	ukpolitics

now the people must realise the broader nature of protesting against the cuts . that such a protest in one nation is futile , for the government is powerless to maintain spending when it must cut taxes for the multinational corporations to ensure we still attract their business , which we are now dependent upon as the nation is far from selfsustainable . note that i do n't just mean direct corporation tax , but also national insurance , income tax etc . as the cost of living must be reduced to a minimum so it is most profitable to employ workers here , for workers are treated like any other commodity in the market system , and to lower their wages their cost of living must fall . ultimately the growth of international capitalism will inevitably destroy the sovereignty of nation states , either indirectly through the dependence previously described or more dramatically through the direct intervention of the imf and the world bank in nations such as ecuador , panama and now even traditionally firstworld '' nations like ireland . who are the people to protest to when the decisions are forced on the nation from afar ? to quote the nobel laureate frederick soddy '' the monetary system is not outworn or senile . it is novel , upstart , and imperious , defeating technological progress by turning it into the channels of destruction , and challenging the autonomy not of one nation but of all alike , so that now the original authorities constituted for the preservation of that autonomy needs must fawn upon it to rule at all . hampered by national frontiers , nothing can satisfy it till the whole world is made safe for banking , that its funda mental insolvency may defy exposure . under the specious guise of a unification of humanity , it aims at absolute dictatorship under which none shall be allowed to live save by its favour and for the advancement of its transcendent whims . '' or the communist manifesto '' the bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population , of the means of production , and of property . it has agglomerated population , centralised the means of production , and has concentrated property in a few hands . the necessary consequence of this was political centralisation . independent , or but loosely connected provinces , with separate interests , laws , governments , and systems of taxation , became lumped together into one nation , with one government , one code of laws , one national classinterest , one frontier , and one customstariff . '' this corrupt system will turn the whole world in to one nation under money , ruled by the effective dictatorship that the inequality of capital produces . to avoid this unsettling future we must unite across nations , and overcome nationalism , patriotism , racism , sexism , homophobia , religious differences and all the divisions the capitalists have created so they can divide and rule . change will not come from above . we have never won any rights from a benevolent monarch or a united nations clause , in fact the main reason we even have the vote is because it was beneficial to the capitalists , who needed more support for their acts supporting free trade and lower taxes . we can not settle for minor concessions like progressive taxation or increased benefits , for these policies amount to pushing peas about the plate as these problems are inherent to the capitalist system . ultimately we have the best technology we have ever had , the highest populations we have ever supported and a productive capacity that could only be dreamt of in previous ages . fundamentally this should be a time of prosperity for all , and yet capitalism is holding us back , for there is no incentive to automate work when it is cheaper to use sweatshop labour , and we must conceal and patent our inventions and discoveries so we can monetize them , rather than allowing everyone to improve upon our ideas . we can never achieve a truly postscarcity society within the capitalist system , for the system itself depends on scarcity . and so when goods become too abundant , it must produce artificial scarcity to maintain profit in their production , as we see with the absurd imaginary property system of patents and copyrights .	c17xezp	ukpolitics

what 's particularly interesting is they 've changed the rules about what constitutes a vote of no confidence it now requires 55 of parliament to vote against the government . seems to strongly suggest that they 're expecting more dissent and that they 've worked out a way to cope with that further dissent . the tories have 47 of the seats and the others combined have less than 55 . so the tories would be immune to votes of confidence even if the lib dems voted against and so did everyone else .	c0pxqf8	ukpolitics

yes but they will be getting 9000 reasons every year to remember this . student politics are usually transitory . unless you give them 27k for 30 years as a good reason to remember you . every pay slip the students get will have a subtle reminder of the issue . that is why the issue is different . it is the gift that keeps on giving . the iraq war was only an issue as long as we were in iraq . student debt will be an issue for the period the students are in debt .	c18eqwl	ukpolitics
good luck . i knew this when i was at uni . my college got rid of a very well respected 'visual culture ' tutor and my class all kicked off about it . i stupidly wrote a 'note ' on facebook about the head doing an awful job ... the next day i was treated like a 5 year old in an interview about a 'slanderous comment on facebook ' . i was nearly expelled off a uni course for defending my rights as a student . the head only proving she was after blood than trying to work with us to gain a better education .	c18ewzn	ukpolitics

it 's one less to deal with . no , it 's one less that we can't deal with . that 's the point . when saddam was under control '' we aided him in the crimes we later used as justification for invasion . the whole moral argument is nonsensical . putting that aside , was it really worth over a million dead iraqi 's to remove one man ? especially when we 've replicated all of his evils , right down to the rape rooms '' . if we 'd behaved ourselves then we might have a leg to stand on in this argument . this is what the un should be doing identifying something which is making the world a worse place to live in , and doing something about it . they did . hence the sanctions that prevented saddam rearming after the first gulf war . it 's fair to say that the world is a worse place postinvasion . islamic terror was foreign to the uk until we jumped on the invasion bandwagon , this cause and effect is noted even in the attackers suicide notes . the uk has been a dick throughout much of history . that does n't make me a dick , does it ? did you try to stop the iraq war ? if you protested it then you are free from blame . if you did n't then you are somewhat responsible . not that the protest mattered but it 's the thought that counts !	c0jfjf4	ukpolitics

the labour vote is down partly by uncontrollable circumstances . i still do n't know what you mean . what was uncontrollable about the decisions to go to war , deregulate the banks or turn the country into a police state ? the tories assume change means it 's their turn . but the majority do n't want them and there is little difference of substance about them . that 's just stupid , you might as well say that a majority of people do n't want labour '' , or lib dems or any party . that 's always gon na be the case , there isnt a single election in recent history where the 2nd and 3rd parties combined havent won more votes than the winner . as for whether the tories have n't changed want to set fire to the unemployed , that remains to be seen . i 'm hoping the lib dems will form a coalition with them and hopefully keep the ordinary people off the bonfire . btw , some humorous retort that shows something or other but likely daily mail related . typical labour voter , expecting someone else to do the hard work for you . p	c0ovfd1	ukpolitics

the conservatives could in theory struggle on as a minority government but if they could not pass any legislation it would serve them no purpose or help their popularity to remain in government , so they would presumably vote in favour of dissolution and thereby the 55 threshold would be reached . the conservatives were considering a minority government if a pact with the lib dems were impossible . they 're close to a majority with the unionists anyway only ten or so short . the fact that no one can bring them down means they can probably survive for some time .	c0pxgg8	ukpolitics

under stv you most certainly do get to vote for people and not for the party . if you can count to 20 it 's not complicated either . if voters find it too hard to do that the uk could use the australian system where voters can number some all all of the boxes , or just vote 1 for a party , and have the party decide where the preferences go . lets say your electorate elects 5 members . each party can have 5 people running for them . say 3 men and 2 women . indpendants can also run . lets say a total of 18 people are running . voters get to number each box 118 or less if they want . if you want to vote for the 2 tory female candidates and not the 3 tory men , just do n't number their boxes . if you are a lib dem voter living in a seat that is a fight between labour and the torys , under stv you can still vote for the lib dem candidates and then number the your preferred candidate from either labour or the torys . you still get to support the party you really want to win , but the eventual winners in your electorate represent a closer view of how the voters voted . the party list system such as the poor euro system we have thank you labour is not what people are wanting . i also find it very interesting that you seem to want a strong government to fix the current mess , when it could be argued that the strong system of government we have had in the past has gotten us into this mess .	c0npsvo	ukpolitics

if their plan is to work it this way , they are playing a dangerous game . if brown steps down , their current electoral campaign hits a wall as most of their campaign was based on how incompetent brown was and how smooth cameron was in comparison . their round 2 would be against a different , possibly weaker , possibly stronger labour . without the infighting and united under a new leadership , labour could prove to be quite hard to deal with . for their plan to force a doomed coalition to work , they would have to have forced clegg to work with brown to try taint him with the same brush . there is a potential problem in that labour may even reinvent itself to counter the new tory popularity without brown the traditional blairbrown duo act is finished they can shift the party away from that approach and pick up on the weaknesses of the tories . it will be interesting to watch .	c0pr78w	ukpolitics

i 'd argue that the principles are right and that there are issues with implementation and consent , although given i am talking to someone who would marry socialism which is hard enough to implement it seems with libertarianism which goes even beyond what i would consider feasibly possible given the nature of the species.. i assume that issues with implementation are ones you may have come across before . i would of course temper that by saying that a self deterministic society with total freedom of association and the absence of private property within the means of production and so complete control over the product of ones labour.. is something that we all theoretically aspire to . do n't know about all , but certainly those of us for whom egalitarianism is a central goal , yes . it 's also true that both socialism and libertarianism seem unpopular today , but that 's mostly about misrepresentation in the media . if you went out and asked people if they wanted to work for a boss , how wealth should be shared , and what sort of work they 'd do if they could choose to without any economic pressure , you 'd probably get a high percentage of libertarian socialist responses . disagree on your nature of the species '' argument , which is deep rousseau vs hobbes philosophy , but can be broadly summed up by the observation that people reflect the society in which they 're brought up . capitalism , especially of the brutal selfish kind , tends to make brutal selfish people and again , yes i understand smith 's observation that selfishness can have positive unintended consequences . for me , in rhetoric and action i will oppose the state relentlessly , but that does n't mean i 'm not also a pragmatist in many ways . i certainly do n't support violent revolution , because i 've seen and read too much about where that leads usually with the replacement of one economic elite with another , after a hell of a lot of death and score settling . does n't mean i would n't make use of one , and certainly i exploit the cracks in capitalism wherever they appear . but in general , i just push towards socialism and libertarianism wherever the carapace of capitalism is weakest .	c2989gh	ukpolitics

amusing that everyone pussyfoots around the obvious . to have meritocracy you need grammar schools selection based on intellectual merit . to make this acceptable you need to invest in the secondarymodern equivalent and have mechanisms for transfer to the grammar stream that mean it does n't come down to just one day 's exams . the simple core of this , and why grammars worked for bright kids from poorer backgrounds and why comprehensives do n't , is that a grammar can build up a culture of hard work and intellectualism . in a comprehensive the tall stalks get cut down .	c1eq0de	ukpolitics

as a teacher , i find this slightly troubling . anyone who works with children has to jump through hoops to ensure that they are suitable people to be around children , and can keep them safe at a minimum . how on earth it is okay for parents to then effectively babysit each others children in the school setting , i have no idea . who is liable for anything that happens to the children in the care of these unqualified other than being parents people ? luckily , i ca n't imagine this being possible . but the suggestion angers me because it undermines the reason teachers , and other public sector workers , are striking because the public sector is paying the price for poor financial management by our own government and risks taken by banks that backfired spectacularly . not only this , but it kind of implies that anyone can do our job temporarily and keep children doing 'something purposeful ' . back us up , parents ! it is a tough job we do , and we all do it because we want to improve things for the children we teach , not to make ourselves rich . tl dr do n't fall for it , parents ! teachers need your support .	c226g2k	ukpolitics

banks create money . if you create pastries , good for you , you will never be short of an eclair , but if you created money then ... the point is the system allows them to wish things into existence , they obviously make the whole process incomprehensible to everyone else , but the net result is the same . if you consider that all risk is now ameliorated by having the tax payer fund all losses , why would n't they ? this works out in a closed system as a taxation at point of creation attached to the currency . meaning the flow of money is taxed where it is made .	c1dk9ud	ukpolitics

to answer the questions do we need to upskill '' and do we need to control economic migration '' , yes to put it simply . but then i would say that the simple things are always really hard . our education system is n't producing the type of people we need to create and fill jobs , we do n't have enough money to reform the education system in order to change this , and while migrants do generate economic growth and tax revenues , we 're already beginning to see the problems of simply importing people to fill jobs , especially in areas where we have issues with lots of under skilled and unemployed natives . it is interesting to note that we seem to have fruit pickers turn up every summer from all over the planet , but not many of them seem to be from areas of the uk with high unemployment . maybe we could look into making our unemployed more mobile so they are able to do these jobs rather than imported workers ?	c2d94ct	ukpolitics

in terms of results per pound the nhs , the nhs is left wanting compared to many of it 's international rivals . which one ? last time i checked the ones that did better all spent a lot more money . we do healthcare on the cheap . it is no good having a health service that is underfunded by international standards , then pointing to well funded ones and shouting see how good it could be '' . singapore has a good system due to price controls . we could do that without privatising the nhs . it would be a good idea . canada , another top class system , does the same thing . however price controls are entirely orthogonal to the privatestate argument .	c1uop3l	ukpolitics

the war on cannabis is a civil liberties disaster , the war on heroin and arguably other hard drugs is a public health and crime disaster , and , more broadly , the government and criminal justice agencies should get the fuck out of our faces where there is no genuine identifiable victim . obviously , if people are neglectingabusing their children or causing significant problems for their communities those issues need to be dealt with and can be under existing arrangements , but no one has a right to tell people how to live their lives if they 're not harming others and that includes not participating or only minimally participating in the capitalist game . edit for clarity , i meant people should be allowed to choose not to participate or to participate at a bare minimum .	c1w5wmh	ukpolitics

the main points i have is that the nhs is a good system , however it is not the best on the planet and it 's not perfect . and perhaps more importantly it is going to face new challenges and a very different operating environment over the next 50 years than it has faced during the previous 50 years . so i do think we will have to examine changes and reforms to the way the nhs is run and is funded . but i do dislike the way that the nhs is used as a political football , by everyone that is involved and that does include the opposition to any changes . it 's a huge issue that we can not debate this topic on any level without it turning into a highly emotive mudslinging match . so no , i do not think that these are the reforms that we need , but there are elements which need to be explored further , in particular the involvement of the private sector , and we need to look at the successes and problems that other universal healthcare systems across continental europe and the world at large .	c31w0bx	ukpolitics

almost all politicians lie i 'm afraid . all of the parties took yes or no positions for cynical reasons of self advancement . although the lib dems have always believed in electoral reform as a key principle . that said , unless you 're a party tribalist you should have voted purely on the principle of whether av was better for the country or not . it is hard to argue that we should retain fptp , but it is also hard for the average voter to be objective when they are bombarded by no propaganda lies supported by rich tory donors . the yes camp did n't do a particularly good job either , but at least they were more or less honest .	c1sp2ln	ukpolitics

but what 's wrong with calling a thief a thief ? i do n't see a problem with that . neither do i. as i stated , it is a fact that he is a thief . i just would n't presume to say whether he 's a better or worse person than me without knowing why he did it . maybe he 's got hungry kids to feed . maybe he 's just a junkie . he 's guilty of stealing either way but he 'll have to make his justifications to someone other than me . it means i understand coming to the draconian position from reading the bible but i would not like to live under that rule . ah i see . well , if it makes you feel any better neither would i. i 'd like to say that such a system would make the world a safe and harmonious place and there are those who say it would but i know enough about people to know there 's always someone who thinks they know better than everyone else . in fact i 'm curious about why your morals are more aligned with a humanitarian approach than christian approach . why are you so happy to see so many biblical rulings left to god . because i personally think that those christians who admonish others for their sins are presuming to speak for god . take those westboro baptist church fuckers for example , each of those placards is a blasphemy , a false witness and a presumption that the bearer knows the will of god . would it be fair to say that you would prefer biblical rulings but are willing to compromise in a secular world for the sake of peace ? but still think god will judge those that break bible teachings such as adulatory ? yes , that 's absolutely fair to say . jesus said render unto caesar the things which are caesar s , and unto god the things that are god s . '' 'caesar ' in this context is usually interpreted to mean 'government ' , and the government owns the law . this is why christians do n't usually run around stoning people any more . now that i think of it , it 's actually a fairly good argument for separation of church and state , which kind of pisses over my arguments for keeping bishops in the house of lords . oh man , i just got schooled by jesus himself ... regarding adultery , let me put it this way . if i know a woman who commited adultery , i think it 's okay for me to say you cheated on your husband '' , but if i say you cheated on your husband . you 're a whore and a slapper and you do n't deserve to ever find another man '' then i 've crossed the line between stating fact and passing judgement . as for gods judgement , that 's between her and god . do n't forget , she may not go to hell for it . that 's for him to decide . he 'll know what 's in her heart better than i ever will , and i find it comforting to know that when my time comes i 'll get the same consideration .	c1xkrhl	ukpolitics
of course . point taken and accepted , albeit i think that it 's definitely sometimes better to attack root causes rather than prune . labour claimed to be pruning at inequality for 13 years and in fact increased it , and that 's happened again and again in situation after situation throughout history . the enemies of economic and social freedom are always active and always play the long game with better resources . they 're also excellent at distracting progressive efforts from things which matter towards things that do n't . however , those who wish to see the greatest possible equality which is compatible with freedom and vice versa should obviously avoid bloodbathinducing instabilities ! i 'm happy to move forward tweak by tweak just so long as each tweak is meaningful .	c23cxth	ukpolitics

'' this sort of rhetoric makes me fucking sick . willful misrepresentation of events is unhelpful , discourages bipartisanship and ultimately does nothing to further anyones cause . heaven forbid we could have some sort of political campaign which does n't resort to lies and personal attacks . but what do i know ? i 'm just an ignorant prole , i 'm sure those political lobbying groups know exactly what the public love to see in their political campaigns .	c1nl58v	ukpolitics

yeah thats pretty close . is singapore a good example too ? i think it might have a slightly bigger state . the problem is the pattern here is they are effectively city states that live off a local area and trade with the rest of the world . if we could circle off the city of london and call it city state then it could probably function in a similar way . a corporate city state . but it does not function in isolation of course the crash would have left london like iceland . i do n't think medium sized countries can ever emulate the economies of a city states . unless a country has access to a vastly bigger economy and super cheap labour on demand .	c1d2ltd	ukpolitics

it is possible to live with a great deal less materially and not exist in victorian '' conditions . you would certainly face a massive drop in life style and conditions if everything was equal . please feel free to provide additional insight in to this . the millions living in grinding poverty whilst a small percentage get to enjoy a middleclass lifestyle might wish to differ . hans rosling URL has some interesting insights into this . what an incredibly smug thing to say as a member of one of the world 's richest nations . were i a starving peasant , i would take this as an invitation to slaughter the rich in their beds . i agree , it follows what you said since we are are of the few my poverty by uk standards is greatly envied by my third world friends it 's easy for us to like capitalism and corporatism.

it 's a fair point and i 'm sympathetic . making things worse through radical structural change is always a risk , and in times like these , there 's a strong conservative tendency to cling to the known . but , as when educating cashcropping developing world farmers in tropical regions about how following western style intensive monocultural farming may bring quick rewards but ultimately will destroy their land because of the nature of the soil , and that they need to switch to permaculture it 's difficult to persuade them to take a risk that might send them spiraling into poverty and starvation . it 's understandable that they are fearful about taking such a potentially devastating risk , but it 's nonetheless in their and their country 's interest that they do so . the trick is to suggest they try it at the periphery and to see how it works , rather than uprooting everything at once and trying something radically new without a safety net .	c2ph112	ukpolitics

hitchens then out right lies . we have n't decriminalised drugs over the past 40 years in all but name . when did we have a time where growing pot at home was legal ? he claims drug use is getting worse . again by what metric , what source ? woman would it have helped you russel if you went to prison ? brand ... prison certainly would n't have helped . w would it have helped ? directed at hitchens hitchens it would have helped him if he was afraid of going to prison ... b that does n't make a difference that . h ... and that 's what a deterrent law does . like in the us ? it is n't designed to throw every one in prison it is design to deter people from taking them in the first place . w surely in order to do that you have to send people to prison ? h of course you have to send some people to prison to show people you mean it , once you have done that they believe you . ? ? ? too many talking con we should n't be tolerating drug usage . why ? once we have them in the system does he mean prison ? who is we ? , we should be making sure they have rehab , and that is what we are trying to do , to make sure we do n't just throw them methad ... h interrupting again why are the prisons you run full of drugs then ? wait a minute ... i thought prison was the answer they are , you make no serious effort to keep them out . b that is too expensive . w people do n't care enough about drug addicts to even send them in prison they want them away somewhere ? h i think people care a great deal . some care so much they redefine addiction as an impossibility especially when this drug problem enters their own family sphere . they wonder where the government is . w so that is basically the problem , people just do n't care about addicts enough ? b yeah , i think that is the problem , but i can even learn to love you peter , and in a minute i shall give you such a kiss on the lips i 'm going to challenge a few of your other prejudices . h oh my dear chap ... looks away in disgust in both directions b let 's get into the homophobia , it 's just under the surface there ... h how does one deal with a person that can not debate seriously , and why is this person brought before select committees and allowed to make programs on the bbc ? interesting he changes the subject b there 's more to debate than acting all posh . h for instance , he uses this expression of criminalisation , the person who criminalises is the person who commits the criminal offense . people are not criminalised , otherwise all that you are saying that all crime is caused by law . that 's a ludicrous proposition . this is a straw man , brand has n't said that . however in the case of at least pot this is true , and is the founding idea of law . everything that is criminal necessarily requires a definition in law . hitchens does n't know the difference between immorality and crime it seems , they are not synonyms . and if he wants to talk law , no law is just without popular support . 40 of adults have disagreed with the law . the program ends with hitchens having talked or interrupted for probably 7 minutes , perhaps more . the 'professional ' got about a minute . why was he even there ? the part i highlighted in bold is truly awful . the people with first hand experience are precisely who should give input . hitchens is a bigot , he does n't listen , and his arguments were entirely baseless pseudomaxims , pure rhetoric , changing of the subject , and bullying . the last thing to say is like always there was a silent framing of debate 'drugs are bad mmmkay ' . everything began from that predicate trying to be a maxim . this was politics and infotainment . this is why people should be reluctant to watch newsnight , and the bbc in general .	c5s7hy1	ukpolitics

dogma not real world examples . you really ca n't cope in a grown up debate with people who disagree with you . you can back up your absurd claim first how you think the www and the lhc where created on a medium sized university budget boggles the mind . where is the evidence for that ? i gave you a source the full version of the very interview you 're commenting on ! yet still you wo n't back up your claim ! ridiculous ! cern budget URL a billion dollars list of university endowments . URL i also found this URL budget report of duke university which shows it took in 4.7 billion dollars in 2011. here 's the budget for penn state URL for michigan URL clearly not ridiculous . you are missing all the wasted money and failures government has backed , all money taken from the private sector . that is where the money is wasted and progress hindered . so your argument against the uk spending 125 million euros 99 million pounds , or just over one hundredth of one percent of its total budget , on cern , is that maybe cern as well as creating antihydrogen , html , the URL the lhc and discovering higgsboson , also did some things that are wasteful , but you 're not going to tell us what they are , because it just sounds like the sort of thing that a government organisation would do according to your dogma ! perfectly rational ! you do realise how you sound ? particularly when the substantive point being made was that unless you 're willing to take a chance on more abstract research that might lead to nothing , you 're not going to come up with the transformative research that we 're talking about . furthermore ... if corporations had that one hundredth of one percent of their taxes back , they would have obviously got together and built a large hadron collider themselves , and the only thing that has stopped them doing this up to now , is that additional one hundredth of one percent which the government took away from them ! never mind the fact that many large corporations put their money offshore to avoid taxes , yet somehow have n't yet built a lhc at the same time ! amazing ! either that or maybe cern is an incredibly worthwhile way to spend government money !	c5b129u	ukpolitics

ok. the national debt '' is not like a loan that you or i take from the bank any journalist comparing it to the nation 's credit card '' need to be shot at dawn . when the government needs to borrow money , hm treasury issues what are known as for historical reasons giltedged securities , or just gilts . think of these as bonds where hm treasury says lend us 50 million for the next 20 years and we will pay you back the full amount at the end plus 3 interest per year '' . as gilts pay a steady rate of interest and are backed by the government and hm treasury , they are seen as one of the safest investments around and are bought by institutional investors , pension funds , private trusts etc etc . now if we just said fuck it '' and decided to stop paying , pretty much every pension fund would collapse . nobody would lend us money and we would have to rely solely on tax revenues to fund every single last penny of government spending , be it your local authority collecting the bins or the government building a new infrastructure project like crossrail . now , you could say that since the government controls the currency then we can just order the royal mint to print moar cashmonies and use that instead to pay for these projects . let me assure you that such a move would be a very bad idea indeed URL	c7ai6br	ukpolitics

you might have some sort of point in a pr system . yep , you 've got me there . only if you ignore the effect of the media , culture and advertising on people 's decision making . as you said , most people are not motivated to get involved . i would further opine that the powers that be like it that way and that the press , the media and politicians like to keep us as ignorant and as uninterested as possible . i agree , again to an extent . however , i do n't see the vested interest the media has in maintaining this status quo , if anything , the media need us to be more interested . a disinterested people have no need for media . i do n't know what to say . do we exist in culture ? do we have media ? do we have institutions ? corporations ? of course we have all of the above , but i do n't believe we are shaped by culture exclusively , as much as we are defined by culture , we define culture and so can never be subservient to it . mediainstitutions and corportations are just extensions of people , and therefore culture . you ca n't see the wood for trees , comrade , and we are all under its control only i know it 's there and you pretend not to know . i would rather act on the assumption i 'm not controlled and be wrong , than assume i am controlled and give up , that would make things all rather pointless to me . my local voting station is next to a baskin and robbins . although i have only once ever made a visit to the latter and too often to the former . in both cases i feel a little let down with myself afterwards . both things seem like a good idea at the time , but shortly afterwards one is left wanting more . perhaps , sadly , there is a similarity between voting and ice cream ... brb off to comfort eat p	c49694k	ukpolitics

if i did i would be aiming at limbs to disable assailants not shooting to kill . there 's a reason literally every police and military organization trains to shoot center mass repeatedly until a threat is disabled . you watch far too many movies and i suspect you have never actually fired a gun . if you had you would n't make ridiculous statements like just shoot him in the leg ! '' that are utter nonsense . you shoot only when somebody is a lethal threat , and once they 're a lethal threat you shoot to disable as quickly as possible ... that means multiple shots center mass in quick succession . if you shoot somebody in the leg before they 're a lethal threat to disable them '' and you hit their femoral artery causing them to bleed to death , you 're going to spend the rest of your life in prison . if you have the time to line up a limb shot '' then you were n't justified to shoot in the first place as your life was n't in immediate danger . guns are lethal weapons and as such they 're a last resort to be used at the very last second , they 're not used to disable individuals by shooting them in the leg except in hollywood . here 's a trick to safety make friends not enemies . nobody cares about that shit . you 've got skinny 13 year old kids running around with firearms just begging for an excuse to fire them ... they 'll end your life for bumping shoulders '' with them .	c5smeey	ukpolitics

well to be honest both unionists and the snp have been talking guff about this issue . alex salmond has rather stupidly been suggesting it was fine and he had the evidence to back it up . on the other side unionists say we 'll be forced out which is arguable . some legal experts say scotland would remain in the eu , others argue it would be otherwise boths sides may have merit . i 'd say a better argument for those of us who support independence to make is that the eu will be something to negotiate after independence and that there is evidence to suggest we would probably remain , especially with most of the eus oil and gas in our waters , unionists would have their own contrary evidence of course but that even if we are in the union our position in the eu is n't sure either what with the eus current attitude to the uk and the tory administrations attitudes . i would be interested to see an opinion poll on the subject , i 've never seen any showing what scotland 's attitude is to the eu or how strongly they feel about it .	c6rnbn4	ukpolitics

given that the problem is that apparently banks wo n't lend , and that i do n't know how this money is distributed or what the terms are to the banks that receive it , clearly the best option is to ensure the money is reaching the people who will use it to stimulate demand ? it does n't seem as much an issue of the banks not having the money to lend , but rather an insistence on their part to not do it , so giving them the money just seems like a bad idea . it would be better spent on projects around the country that the banks are refusing to lend for . in fact , i would probably require the banks to compile a list of loan requests that have been turned down with reasoning behind it and evidence to suggest their reasoning is sound , then they could perhaps have a review board that reassesses their decisions on the basis of funding the bank to lend the money to the business . it potentially could end up being lost , but at least it would be being spent somehow .	c3pga0x	ukpolitics

you do n't need to store wind . you just need there to be some wind somewhere in the country . it does n't need gales either . the way it works is that wind turbines run at constant speed and actually draw power if the wind is n't fast enough to drive them . as long as there is some sort of breeze in the uk there will be power generated . the idea is to set up enough capacity that on average there will always be so much . it is n't as unreliable as people believe though admittedly storage would allow us to increase capacity more cheaply . it is worth noting , in the uk at least , that power demand varies with wind power output anyway . though there are all sorts of tricks to avoid this today .	c4qyqaj	ukpolitics

slyrachet indeed . you 're saying that you would reject the outcome of a referendum basically because you disagree with what other people think and then you 're saying that referendums are undemocratic ... seriously ? this is a strawman . i never made such a claim . the implicit claim i made is self evidently uncontroversial for any collective decision on a particular issue to be sound there is the requirement that there not be any corrupting information and the people be suitably educated . the economy has little to do with democracy look at china and the press has little to do with it ether . how wrong you are democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives . democracy allows eligible citizens to participate equallyeither directly or through elected representativesin the proposal , development , and creation of laws . it encompasses social , economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political selfdetermination . URL what does it matter that everyone has a vote if that vote can be corrupted , say , by a wealthy australian monopolising the media ? how one spends money is far more impactful on selfdetermination than the casting of a largely meaningless ballot every four years or so . those who are given the privilege of creating money is far more important . the same goes for how we educate our children and how we use our time .	c7b4npa	ukpolitics

there 's a practical economic argument for not cutting the benefits rise to below inflation . people who rely on these benefits are spenders . the money that comes in goes straight back out again into the economy . at a time when consumer confidence is so low and the government needs people to spend more , it does n't make sense to limit the incomes , and so spending power , of those most likely to put their money into the businesses around them . a portion of this will then find its way back into the treasury through taxation . the economy needs stimulus and this benefits cap will only make things worse .	c7jocyg	ukpolitics
there is so much to critique in your response here i do n't really know where to start . i 'll have a go anyway ... i think you 've mistaken me for a hardleft communist , and i 'm not . i think that right now , the people right at the top of the income and wealth distribution have too much , and that they have largely earned it either due to their entrenched privilege an eton oxbridge education goes a long way but only if daddy can afford it or due to the benificence of society as a whole if you do get into oxbridge from a state school , you probably had a good set of teachers , lived in a nice neighbourhood with low crime , etc . a third group are the outright criminals in the financial services industry who continually pump and crash the economy and cream off the profits into their own pockets inside job is a fantastic account of the criminality involved in the 2008 crash , i highly recommend it . yes , there are some genuine selfmade entrepreneurs whose success should be praised and encouraged and who deserve in their lifetime to reap the rewards of their talent and ingenuity , but i say that earning more than , say , 250,000 a year is more than any person could ever need and that it is in the interest of the state to take a serious look at how to constrain the hoarding of wealth that those right at the top are exhibiting , to the detriment of the rest of us . note that i 'm not , here at least , specifically saying that we should take money off the fantastically wealth andor highearning and give it to the poorest your welfare queens '' in fact i think a lot of the benefits specifically targeted at the extremely poor would be more socially acceptable and thus less stigmatized if they were universal benefits i believe everyone should be guaranteed an income enough to satisfy a basic standard of living food , shelter , clothing and we 'd be better off as a society if that meant a universal benefit paid to all , regardless of income , age , disability , etc . i pretty much agree on the free schools , so long as they are done right and properly regulated kids only get one chance at a primary education so it ca n't be so bad that it 's worthless . otherwise i am all for experimentation in learning , i think there 's a lot of efficiency and quality improvements to be had there , and i also agree that breaking out of the union pay scales is worth doing too , so that good teachers are able to command a good wage and that poor teachers will give up and leave the system . finally , on getting britain back to being competitive '' according to wolfram alpha URL , british gdp per head or productivity '' rose from about 22k in 1997 to about 37k in 2010 after the bubble , which saw a high of 46k . unemployment in britain is running the same as in the almighty usa , germany and russia 7.5 , and better than canada 8 , france , italy , brazil 8.5 , european average 11.5 . competitiveness '' does n't really seem to be under threat right now .	c6jkiz0	ukpolitics

you have to be pragmatic about these things . at the end of the day ideology is fun to talk about but is at most a rough guide to your decision making process , and quite often the reality of available options does n't even closely resemble what you might like to do in an ideal world . so you have to compromise . when you are talking about party a providing goods andor services to party b for an agreed price you need to have some protection to ensure that everyone does what they agreed to do . if there was no come back for taking money to run a 7 day bus service and only running a 5 day service then it would be impossible for anyone to do business . or , in possibly a more relevant form , if you take out a cell phone contract for x minutes , x texts and x amount of data , at y per month for z months , do you not think that you should have some protection from the firm suddenly saying the price has doubled but your calls , minutes and data are now halved ! '' ? as for ip , i do think there should be some protections for ip , after all if your a small company who has developed a way of making very efficient solar cells at a cheaper price than anyone else and you 've sunk a lot of money into the r d i do think that you should be able to protect your processes and technology , other wise there is nothing to prevent a bigger firm simply taking your work and running with it . but what i want to see is the abuse of the system , particularly in regard to things like the phone button being red , or the device being a rectangle , being stamped out . it was never intended for this purpose and it needs to be reformed , not deposed of completely . as for the corporation , what is it you do n't like in particular ? the idea of corporate personhood or is the the whole idea of a private organization as a separate legal entity that has privileges and liabilities that are distinct from those of its members ?	c4oyfq8	ukpolitics

imperialism is a expression of economic relations on a global scale . it 's a well understood concept . it 's rather silly to accuse argentina as an argument in defence of british foreign policy . the age of imperialism was a time period beginning around 1870 when modern , relatively developed nations were taking over less developed areas , colonizing them , or influencing them in order to expand their own power . although imperialist practices have existed for thousands of years , the term age of imperialism '' generally refers to the activities of nations such as the united kingdom , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states in the early 18th through the middle 20th centuries , e.g. , the the great game '' in persian lands , the scramble for africa '' and the open door policy '' in china . more on wikipedia URL even if you would like to accuse argentina of offensive posture the term imperialism is not accurate . you could try expansionist and even that is subjective .	c4b1m8e	ukpolitics

they could pull it off with the lib dems , but only if the lib dems had a substantially different leadership . of the current prominent lib dems , i 'd imagine only vince cable would be acceptable to most labour mps and party members . the lib dems would n't be in a position to complain about such a deal , as getting rid of the labour leader was their main condition for coalition with labour during the fallout of the 2010 election . the specific reason i believe that labour could do it is that they 've seen just how pliable the lib dems have been in coalition with the conservatives , and the argument could easily be made that they 'll be equally easy to sway when working with labour . as a labour member , i 'd rather see a coalition with the lib dems than with the greens , because i find the greens ' antiscience position s absolutely infuriating . obviously my preference would be for an outright labour win , though .	c7crz3q	ukpolitics

as i said elsewhere it does have merit in some cases , but they are very specific areas . i just do n't see how useful it is to provide big stores with seemingly endless supplies of free labor . ultimately , the problems we have with systemic unemployment are going to take at least a generation to make any serious headway on . the education system is turning out way to many people who are just unsuitable for employment , and combined with immigrants who seem to have a much more pragmatic approach to working and a welfare system that somewhat coddles people we 've got a huge problem on our hands . even more so now the money is getting dangerously low . i honestly do n't know what the solution is , i just know that it 's going to take a long time to fix and unfortunately out political system is n't able to handle long term projects .	c3epd97	ukpolitics

i work as an nhs pensions officer and i have to say that recently i 've seen a lot more people retiring , and most of them are nurses . nurses who started paying into the pension before march of 1995 have a special clause which lets them take their pension at age 55 without any reduction , as opposed to the normal age of 60 65 for members of the 2008 section of the scheme . many nurses genuinely enjoy their jobs and are extremely passionate and dedicated about care . consequently many of them do n't actually use this clause and keep working until they are 60 , often beyond . recently however a lot of them have started to use the clause and are leaving . we discuss retirement with our staff as part of the process sometimes their reason for retirement is better fulfilled by other means or retirement really would n't be beneficial for them , and there 's a very strong current running through clinical staff that they simply ca n't do their jobs effectively any more . the most common complaint is that they are now required to focus on targets quotas and other ephemeral goals instead of caring for the patients who need them . many of these nurses are from the 'old school ' and loosing them is a massive blow to the collective experience of the trust , not to mention their role as tutors for younger colleagues . the finance team of course are happy to see them go one less paycheck to cut . i worry a lot , especially as many of the nurses we are loosing are from the neonatal unit . if the nhs needs to save money then it needs to be done through better management as opposed to carving up the people doing the actual work , for whatever reason they may be leaving . currently we may be saving money but we 're doing at the expense of quality of service .	c5x6xg1	ukpolitics

i do . mass unemployment in the sector due to the global economic recession . so i 'd be going up against people with tens of years of experience in almost every case . as i said , it was n't due to lack of applications , or unwillingness to work almost anywhere . i would have happily been working at mcdonalds rather than be unemployed , or as a administratortype role . the issue is n't that people with degrees deserve a job . the issue is that you can be overqualified for certain lower paygrades but underqualified for higher pay grades , putting you right in a gap where you 're almost unemployable . many graduates who have n't been extremely fortunate will tell you the same story . many of the people who knew this was coming did the smart thing and stuck around to do a master 's , which not only buys time before you 're in the job market but also maybe puts you above the gap in terms of employability .	c3k3ir4	ukpolitics
well ok , let 's take a more well defined set of parameters . anyone on the sunday times rich list has both assets and capital to weather any financial storm . when the market expands their businesses make lots if cash and their countable wealth goes up . when the market contracts their net worth in currency appears to go down but something else happens too . smaller competitors are either absorbed or extinguished , larger companies consolidate and the market becomes less competetive . most of us have to use more of our savings during a recession , if we 're lucky enough to have them , and also we have to tighten our belts . the result is that rather than being all in it together '' in a downturn , recessions actually benefit the rich by putting them in an advantageous position at the beginning of the business cycle . you may regard it as the effect on the markets of sensitive dependance on intitial conditions .	c7azkiq	ukpolitics

1 URL 2 URL for but two networks . as i have iterated several times , check the news for more . right , so you do a quick google search to back up your assertions , come up with two websites only one of which is uk based and then put the onus of research on me ? no , sorry it does n't work like that . see above . see above for what ? some people flouting the rules of christianity yet still calling themselves christian . hell , i 'm a pork eating , kuffar muslim . cant touch me ! prioritizing ending discrimination over people 's right to discriminate is illogical . back to the arrogance again . i 'm sure your shit does n't stink either . the world is n't perfect yet you 'll demand perfection from it anyway . and if you 're not perfect , well then world must adjust its perceptions ! oh and i 've never referenced the nazis on this , i do apologise . you see , you 're not the only one i 'm debating with today . the other guy did make nazi analogies and i got you mixed up . to err is to be human , no ? you ca n't actually spot a reference to one of the iconic symbols of american apartheid , instead assuming it 's a reference to fascism . i 'm well aware of the history . it 's just that invoking jim crow laws is rather hyperbolic since abandoning separate water fountains is not really same as forcing someone to renounce the core tenets of their religion . to be honest , the fact that you 're trying to make out like it 's the same is intellectually dishonest as well as an insult to the genuine victims of racism in the united states . you evidently missed turning your accusatory logic against you . hmm , not really since i have n't claimed that i 'm not a bigot in your terms . i have no doubt you consider me to be a bigot . that does n't bother me , what bothers me is your willful blindness to your own ignorance . see above . again ? i assume you 're referring to the lazy citations you made . how are they relevant here ? unless you 're invoking the heavens , haha ! never said catholics wanted contraception banned where did i say you did ? in fact you 've missed the entire point . you bring up catholics and coe as though they 're one and the same , which again highlights your ignorance . your responses have now become half arsed and slipshod the reason you think this is because you do n't understand half the points i 'm making . you 're largely ignorant of the concerns raised by carey . you 'd rather file it under 'bigotry ' and ignore it protip that wont make it go away . but let 's go back to the original point you know , the point that you 've been making increasingly verbose statements about in order to justify that you ca n't make logical arguments to justify a subjective opinion about an illogical subject matter . the only way you can do so is by performing mental acrobatics excellently summarised by the fact that you need walls of text to explain your position . i believe that 's a fallacy called proof by verbosity have a lovely day !	c6jz2u1	ukpolitics

needless to say , our huge liabilites in the 20s , 30s , 40s and 50s were necessitated by two world wars . national debt came down rapidly and consistently during the midlate 19th century , and was significantly lower than it is now just prior to ww1 there was a lag in the effects of the industrial revolution because , again , we were financing various wars at the end of the 18thearly 19th century . we had phenomenal trade surpluses in the 19th century , and good trade surpluses for the majority of 20th century , too . going into debt should only be an option if you can feasibly pay it off . right now , we are in no position whatsoever to pay it off .	c83bun2	ukpolitics

the gold lost us a few billion , but it was about the incompetency not just the amount . the gold lost us 12 billion URL , while the net cost of eu budget contributions to britain in 2011 was just under 11 billion URL . the eu 's much worse than just a loss of money , but still , that 's the financial equivalent of delaying the referendum an extra year . not cheap . the incompetency is one of the differences between labour and the tories . you 're right on the lisbon treaty point . you 're not the official opposition , and then elected , and unable to do anything about a treaty , so i 'll agree it was chiefly for political capital . labour and conservatives begrudgingly go along securing opt outs . blair gave up britain 's rebate , and labour is more begrudging than the conservatives , so the tories are better than labour as well as the libdems here . look at what matters . on the economy new labour carried the clarke policy in its first term . they continued with privatisations . they continued with council tax . when it comes to cuts they 're just outside being a carbon copy . i think privatisations are a good thing and one of the things the tories get better than ukip . sure there 's differences but they 're only really moving deckchairs from port to starboard . the general direction of the ship is the same . ukip by comparison is a completely different course . i agree with the general analogy , but i think the details of the boat 's furniture is relevant regardless of course . ukip gets the course right , but that does n't mean it is n't important to have working deckchairs in the right place . i 'm not saying the tories are better than ukip , but i think they 're comparable whether we 're in the eu or not , they 'll both move the uk in the right direction , unlike the other parties . the eu is an exception to that that the tories get wrong , but now that tory leadership has accepted a referendum , it 's an exception that should n't cost us getting out .	cckkfot	ukpolitics

anyone over the age of 13 or 14 , including those keynesian academics , intuitively knows this . unfortunately intuition is frequently wrong . creating new money benefits society because we need it . the amount of money is increasing in the uk at about 15 a year calculated from the average of a few years in the 2000s from here URL . inflation is way below that inflation was about 23 URL in the time period i looked at . so the evidence shows that creating more money is not inherantly bad . and remember the government targets 2 inflation by changing interest rates so most of that is intentional as deflation is much worse , it 's better to always have a small amount of inflation . we could create more than 15 by raising interest rates , within reason . i do agree we should n't let the banks create so much of our money , i 'd rather we lowered taxes and spent it on public services . the boe bought 30 of our government debt with new money quantative easing which proves that it can be done .	cds0qqw	ukpolitics

rather i think we should reintroduce grammar schools so that the children from decent families can at least have a chance to escape the chavs who have no respect for education or teachers . i 've never heard a grammar school advocated admit that grammar schools are just about helping middle class kids escape poor kids before . do you seriously want to maintain and propagate an underclass of citizen , because that 's what happens when you trap all the poor kids in the same school and give all the funding to the grammar schools ? these are the long term unemployed people on benefits that the right rails against . the people who come from impoverished families and were n't helped by the education system . you ca n't abjectly refuse to help them and effectively abandon them as a society at the age 4 and then endlessly whinge when they do n't become productive and respectful members of that same society . what happened to aspiration , what happened to 'compassionate conservatism ' ? getting your education from a school with a diverse student body helps everyone . almost entirely white , middle class , singlesex grammar schools produce a lot of absolute arseholes . i speak from the experience of having gone to one . meanwhile exclusively impoverished schools produce kids with very poor life prospects and a lot of anger at society . we 're producing our own criminals and benefits dependants every time we separate kids on socioeconomic grounds . separate but equal never works , and this is hardly even equal .	ca1f9m6	ukpolitics

i think it 's too early for this ... yet . with the advance in technology , more and more jobs are automated . manufacturing is just about there , a lot of manufacturing jobs are just supervising and maintaining the automated machinery . there are stories dotted about which involve robots replacing people for menial tasks . we 're coming towards a time when this will be the norm , that vast numbers of people will be layed off because robots will be able to perform the job more efficiently faster speed , lower costs and maintain a higher level of quality by removing human error . the big obvious one is how retail is beginning to collapse . sure , for clothes and groceries it is ok for now , but for electronics , musicfilms , toys , books , and so on , we 've already entered a time where nobody wants to go out and buy these things any more . the number of retail jobs lost because of this is far greater than the number of jobs created by the ever growing online shopping industry . the number of jobs is decreasing , but overall productivity is increasing . eventually we will get to the point where the unemployed are the majority . not because of overpopulation or a poor economy , but because humans are no longer required to accomplish certain tasks efficiently . when this happens , we have to introduce something like this to prevent widespread poverty and income inequality . short of culling the population , there is no other realistic solution . once businesses find that they can manufacture in the uk using robots for half the price of paying people , even in 3rd world countries , they will stop hiring .	c8imixj	ukpolitics

i 'm by no means a fan of ukip at all , but i can see both sides here . on one hand , it 's certainly a valid point that individuals party members or not holding such views does n't necessarily reflect poorly on the party as a whole . i 'm sure you could find plenty of cardcarrying labour , tory or whatever else have you members that hold equally stupid and bigoted opinions . it 's always these kinds of people that get more media coverage , both due to rabid media sensationalism and the tendency of the ignorant to fill in the gaps in their knowledge about what they 're talking about with bloodyminded enthusiasm . whether ukip has a higher proportion of racists compared to other parties , i honestly do n't know , but i do n't think the party itself is intrinsically racist unlike say , the bnp , even if some of its policies might attract them . on the other , ukip is just going to have to deal with it if they want to play in the big leagues . stepping into the limelight means dealing with the increased scrutiny that entails . farage needs to start dealing with these racist sentiments within his party rather than pretending they do n't exist if he honestly does n't want it to turn into nothing more than a middleclass bnp . both the media and the bigger parties are going to be watching them like hawks for any slipups , because sadly , that 's just how british politics is shitslinging and hypocrisy .	c7w3yrz	ukpolitics

'' intolerant of intolerance '' this is an interesting trap lots of people fall into when they start considering aspects of liberal society . you can quite literally drive yourself mad trying to resolve the apparent paradox , but karl popper dealt with it quite well over fifty years ago . to wit unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance . if we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant , if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant , then the tolerant will be destroyed , and tolerance with them . in this formulation , i do not imply , for instance , that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion , suppression would certainly be unwise . but we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument , but begin by denouncing all argument they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument , because it is deceptive , and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols . we should therefore claim , in the name of tolerance , the right not to tolerate the intolerant . we should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law , and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal , in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder , or to kidnapping , or to the revival of the slave trade , as criminal . karl popper , the open society and its enemies 1945	c7rfza7	ukpolitics

local selfgovernance does n't mean no more cooperation between communities . not none , but less . the further you devolve power to a local level you will see a more local governments competing against each other to set the lowest tax particularly corporation rates . the whole argument of devolved power is improved competition as though this is a universally good thing . and b less bureaucratic infrastructure spanning regions making any cooperation less efficient . why is the central government on the people 's side and local government in opposition to the people who elect it ? it 's not a case of local government being in opposition to working in peoples best interest , it 's a lack of power . this is going to sound melodramatic , but as we move into the future we are going to see corporations overtake governments as a hegemonic force . the tussle of power between governments and corporations has been going on for centuries but it is essential that the state stays at a size large enough to be a force to be reckoned with . if it is not we will descend into corporatism . could you imagine a county trying to enforce worker and consumer protection such as a minimum wage or the working time directive ? never mind create them from scratch .	c9zh2zt	ukpolitics

the supposed bias '' towards labour is due to lower turnout in labour constituencies . that 's a contributory factor , but labour 's constituencies do have smaller electorates on the whole too . from a paper at the lse URL labour tends to win in smaller constituencies . the average size of labour constituencies is 68,487 whereas the average size of conservative constituencies is 72,418. this is partly due to fact that labour performed much stronger than the conservatives in wales and scotland where constituencies tend to be smaller than in england . the average size of constituencies in wales is 56,628 and in scotland 65,475 , whereas the average size in england is 71,858 . but even within england , the average size of labour constituencies is 70,252 as compared to the average size of conservative constituencies of 72,816 . labour tends to win in constituencies with smaller voter turnout . the average turnout in labour constituencies was 61.1 whereas the average turnout in conservative constituencies was 68.3 . similarly , the tories are far from alone in stacking up massive majorities in safe seats indeed the biggest majority in the house at present is the labour mp stephen timm URL 's , at 27,826 though this is actually also a fairly large constituency ! . if you look at the data presented at the bottom of this guardian article URL and sort the seats by size , you 'll notice a heavy slant to labour in the smaller seats though the snp have the 'record ' in na heileanan an iar the western isles which has an electorate of barely over 21,000 for geographic reasons . going back to that lse article the conservatives received 7.1 more votes and secured 306 seatswhich is 7.4 more seatsthan labour ukwide . so between those two parties alone that seems like a fairly close correlation ? well , unless you reverse the situation ... imagine a counterfactual election which is just like the 2010 election except for the following feature . in this election labour received 7.1 more votes than the conservatives ukwide due to the fact that , within each constituency , labour received 7.1 more votes and the conservatives received 7.1 less votes than they actually did . we now calculate how many seats labour and the conservatives would have secured in this counterfactual election . as it turns out , labour would have secured 354 seats , which is not 7.4 more seats , but 23.2 more seatsi.e . much more than 7.4 than the conservatives . as to cutting the numbers of mps it was the lib dems who wanted the biggest cut in numbers URL of mps at the last election !	c7zcogo	ukpolitics

by 'wasted ' , i assume you mean that by voting green you would miss the opportunity to influence the election in a meaningful way . but the fact is that , in general elections , huge numbers of the votes cast are 'wasted ' . in all those extremely safe conservative seats that have n't changed hands since ww2 , for instance , all votes for labour and the lib dems have no meaningful impact on the outcome . and all the many thousands of votes which give the winner a large majority are also 'wasted ' . and labour have lots of very safe seats too . so often there is no harm in voting green . and in european and local elections , there might be a realistic chance of the green candidate being elected . also , in parliamentary elections all candidates have to pay a deposit of 500 , which is refunded if they get 5 or more of the vote . so if you support the greens , voting for them can at least help them get their deposit back .	c90m8qr	ukpolitics

i do think we should be taking much more action on things like the death of iain hook , a british engineer and crown agent seconded to unrwa and killed by the idf in jenin . in my view the way in which that matter was brushed under the carpet by hmg was shameful . indeed i agree , i had heard something of this case myself . the uk is certainly giving backing to israel even if it is n't quite as absolute or obvious as americas . i 'd like to see the uk do a lot less of that . it goes without saying that it 's not usually in the interests of ordinary people in the middle east . i suspect it 's not in the longer term interest of ordinary people in the uk either . again i agree completely , my point was merely that the uk has become entangled in middle eastern affairs and i doubt is well thought of by many middle eastern people and this will be a difficult thing to shake now and can affect us badly , that is why i am quite noninterventionist in my political views on foreign policy because when you become involved in another country or region 's affairs you can never tell what will end up happening and also because no government becomes involved in another 's affairs out of benevolent reasons but out of selfinterest and power . in a hypothetical situation though a strong public statement of disapproval by the uk of illegal israeli settlements and it 's blockade of gaza may bring some much needed goodwill from the people of the middle east .	c7rpumi	ukpolitics

'' this means that the use of placebos relies on being dishonest to the patient , which most people would see as unethical . if even one person says homeopathy has cleared their lethargy , or if acupuncture has relieved their weird knee pain then fine , it should be on the nhs , as it has a result attributed to it . most minor medical problems get better by themselves . people often believe a remedy worked just because it happened to coincide with that which is one of the reasons placebocontrolled trials are necessary . even if we were to treat people with placebos , we would have no reason to go for homeopathy the proponents of homeopathy generally do n't even believe it is a placebo , so it is clearly not designed to maximise the placebo effect .	cbf32g1	ukpolitics

not really . you might disagree with cameron 's policies but he 's actually been pretty successful at what he has wanted to achieve . hollande is just a train wreck . no voice abroad , no voice at home . he 's a consensus politician and france is n't a consensus country , especially when it comes to their presidents . the fifth republic demands a strong executive and about 6 months after his election the majority of france had woken up to the reality that they 'd elected a weak leader who 'd never even governed before . i remember being at my inlaws ' shortly after his election could n't have been more than 5 months and seeing an issue of le point with a portrait of holland with the headline 'the hypnotiser ' . for heaven 's sake , his nickname is flambi . this is a flambi . URL cameron , on the other hand , is increasingly popular among average european voters , despite SUBREDDIT 's sincerest efforts to circlejerk . i 'm not saying the pm is perfect there are plenty of things he has done of which i 'm not a fan , the royal mail privitisation being one of them but he 's no hollande . i agree with USER i think miliband would be a weak leader . it 's not about wits and decisions that 's what meetings with you political allies and your policy wonks are for . it takes charisma and an image to convey yourself to the public so that they can have confidence in you and your government , but also to sell your country and its ideas to foreign investors , diplomats and citizens . miliband has all the image and charisma of someone who was dropped on his nose as a child .	ccfpxjl	ukpolitics
i 'm concerned about limiting interest like this . if theres one thing all economists agree on it 's that price freezescaps just do n't work , and this is effectively that . theres obviously real demand for the services wonga etc . provide , and we 're making their business model unsustainable , or at least forcing it to change they can bring their income back up to the level they need to operate by offering secured rather than unsecured loans but being unseured i part of wonga 's appeal , and actually a very good thing for people with few assets . thy can pursue defaulters more rigorously but they 'll be slated for doing that too and there are legal limits on how far they can go . or they can only offer loans to people with a better chance of paying them back but that 's taking the service away from those who need it most . it 's econ 101 price cap leading to a shortage . finally , can we stop calling payday lenders predatory '' and calling the people who patronize them thick . both are rational actors engaging in mutually beneficial exchange .	cdml6zo	ukpolitics
lysander spooner was rightly bamboozled by the notion of an invisible contract with no defined terms or stipulations whatsoever URL oh , but the contract is implicit , right ? by me not moving to another country i thereby endorse the actions of the state , whatever they may be , right ? that is necessarily your implication . if theft is justified , why not kidnapping or murder ? i guess the business owners who are extorted by the sicilian mafia for protection '' money every week are also endorsees , right ? and i guess the jews who lived in nazi germany , under a democratically elected government have only themselves to blame for not leaving before they were evicted from their homes , rounded up and enslaved in concentration camps , right ? there was a social contract '' , after all , and the nazi german government provided them with services such as some food and shelter .	cdrtp8s	ukpolitics

i can agree . my council 's planning dept is surely composed of the most moronic people ever to set foot on earth . they 're about to approve a housing development '' of 29 houses near me , on land that would barely fit 2 of the houses across the road where i live they are n't big houses , but they have decent and usable gardens . this development was once denied but magically approved once a few houses were designated as affordable '' not on cornish wages it is n't and probably the necessary backhanders obtained . then the recession hit , nothing happened and it 's back for another go . on a road where traffic is already ridiculous because of all the traffic going to the nearby town , where the sewage comes up sometimes because it 's overloaded , and in a village whose school is totally full and ca n't expand . roads , by the way , often have potholes . at least one aroad not a highways agency controlled road had a pothole over 30cm big and probably 10cm deep . that 's a suspension killer if ever i saw one . plenty of money for the usual selfcongratulatory shite though . why ca n't the school expand ? because they approved a massive housing development bordering two sides of the school one side is the road and the other is an ancient pub . good work , guys ! when i went to the school years ago they actually had a decent bit of grass to play on , now it 's a car park , nursery and whatever else they 've decided to put there plus plenty of those houses , ideal for the person who wants to watch small children all day my dad as a business owner does n't have too many nice things to say about them either . in fairness they 're trying to do a few good things they helped bring fibre optic broadband to almost all of the county , years before bt would ever plan to do it , they 've developed a local replacement for ema , they have't yet closed every library and leisure centre , they 're trying hard to get investment in our rail and road networks the ones that do n't have potholes , but some of the stuff they do is just mind boggling .	c84xg6t	ukpolitics

no one likes a big debt hanging over them . well , no , but i 'd rebut that by pointing out that anyone who believes a uk student loan is remotely the same as a commercial loan of the same amount is probably a bit below the bar intelligence wise to be considering a degree . presumably there would be some way to collect the tax , much like how we collect student loan repayments from those who move abroad . you might presume that , but in practice that law is rather toothless , and only enforceable if you intend on coming back and rejoining the uk tax system . in reality , the government is powerless to chase the debt . some people go on paying it because of the threat of being pursued for the money on their return if they do n't , but what actually happens is they dont get into trouble if they dont pay it , and after a few years the government gives up and write off the debt . encourage students get the education but then not to actually graduate , that would be ridiculous and any sensible system would prevent this . how ? many students only go to university because they dont know what else to do with themselves . why not enjoy a few years of taxpayer subsidised shagging and drinking , and then get a nongraduate job ? many people do this now , even with the student loans . i know a couple of people who did . encourage students to take the first years in the uk , and then finish off their degree abroad to avoid the tax . see above . umm , the above response did n't address this . i 'm sure student loans would stay the same for those who already have them ... ... can you imagine the outrage if suddenly 40 and 50 year old people had to start paying a graduate tax ? well , i 'd be outraged , but this is britain , so the overwhelming majority would just roll over and take it up the ass as usual . i do n't share your trust in whitehall . once the government has gotten over the initial hump of introducing a new tax , the can salami slice , year on year , sneaky little increases to the scope and rate of this tax . soon it would have had a name change , and would be being applied to sixth formers and who knows who else . that 's what they do . break the link between the cost of education , and the payment for it , there should n't be a link between the two . it just discourages poor people . holy jesus , this subreddit never ceases to amaze me in terms of how deep the rot of entitlement culture goes . create yet another form of tax , to be fiddled with year on year by successive governments . they 're already trying to fiddle with student loans . q.e.d as regards my comments in a graduate tax . all that said , i actually think we should abolish tuition fees . i tend to agree , but not for bullshit subjects , only for ones that are beneficial to both the student and the country at large . not for horseshit subjects like liberal arts , gender studies , fashion , and sociology .	cl32hi4	ukpolitics

supplementary vote and stv they 're too complicated and will confuse voters . is n't supplementary vote the system used for the london mayoral elections , basically av but you only get to pick first and second preferences and everyone but the top two gets knocked out in the first round ? i 'd say it 's far easier to understand than additional member or party list systems . the obvious criticism is that , unlike all the other systems mentioned , it makes no attempt to achieve proportionality . party lists voters do n't directly elect their representative and ca n't directly vote them out there are open party list systems where this is n't the case , but the title specified closed party list for some reason .	cf5gfxp	ukpolitics

the thing that really has wound me up is the no income tax for minimum wage '' so what if i 'm earning just above it ? if you 're just earning about it , say 15k then you 'll get 13.5k tax free and be taxed at 20 on the remaining 1.5k which is 300 . you 'll then have 14.7k before your other deductibles like ni or student loans come out . under the current system you 'd have 10k tax free and 5 taxed at 20 . you 'd pay 1k tax before other deductibles leaving you with 14k before other deductibles . oh , and before you go and say 700 is nothing well for many its the difference between making a mortgageURL payment or paying the bills . for others its the difference between putting full meals on their childrens tables and not being able to provide them with breakfast each morning before school . for many its the difference between being able to purchase the new school uniform and struggling to buy it through loans which cause them further problems like stress so lets not pretend this money is nothing . doing so is nothing more than a cheap shot at the working class of this nation . a party that denies that climate change is man made despite scientific consensus ? that 's laughably ignorant . quite hilarious really that you 're proven to be overwhelmingly ignorant yourself . there is evidence from both sides of the argument that it is man made and it is not man made . there are very high profile figures on either side stating such . there are countries all over the world who simply do not care so our efforts are made in vain often because the damage is still ongoing . recent studies have even said what happens cant be reversed . why do you ignore those studies to only listen to the studies you want to hear ? because you are ignorant . you 're the ignorant one here . not ukip . you . you like many others listen to what you want to listen to because it 's all that supports your argument . their stance on gay marriage shows what bigots they are . they do n't want gay marriage to be forced upon the church . why do you favour one sect of society over another ? you 're the bigot . you 're the person who thinks the rights of one sector of society should expose another to risk because of our eu links . if farage or ukip were against gay people they 'd propose a reversal of civil partnerships but they are n't so climb down off your self enlightened perch and educate yourself .	ckttxqw	ukpolitics

the chain of events leading up to this conflict was to do with the murdered israeli boys , but in terms of the current fighting in gaza those boys are an irrelevant sideshow really . the military operation at the moment aims to take out the tunnels and rockets that are being used to attack israel . this operation was going to happen eventually anyway , israel could not tolerate such threats for long and hamas is always itching for a fight . even if it was done by hamas , i do n't think it justifies the current state of affairs , where they have literally killed thousands of innocent people . hamas is trying to make this look like israel is declaring collective punishment on the palestinians over the murder of the three israeli boys , but that is just hamas spun propaganda and not remotely true . if israel did n't start this conflict it would be over already . you are literally blaming the victim . if the israeli government did n't fire the rockets , then the people would n't have died . it was not started by israel . hamas is constantly attacking israel , israel is doing what it needs to do to defend itself . and please do n't tell me about how hamas uses people as shield . have you seen gaza ? it 's literally a fourth or fifth the size of london ! this is another myth , there are fields and patches of land all over the gaza strip that make for safe launch sites . they do n't need to be storing rockets in hospitals or launching them from schools . hamas wants civilians to die , it is n't stupid , it knows that public opinion turns against israel every time they bomb a hospital or school . the people of the gaza strip are the only resistance left against israelis who are trying to get their land back . if they are willing to use force then they must be willing to die . israel will win the long game one way or another . how you can be on the side of israel i do not understand when you do actually look at the facts . if israel did n't want this war , then they could just stop killing civilians . i think it 's the rockets from them that are killing the majority of the people not hamas . the difference between israel and hamas is that hamas want to murder civilians while israel just wants to protect its own people and is willing to accept civilian casualties to that end . the united kingdom has killed thousands of civilians in many wars . there were even civilian casualties in the falklands war , killed by british shelling . when you are fighting for what is right you often end up killing those who have done no wrong . israel has not choice . if israel really wanted peace then they would cease the blockade of gaza , cease the blockade of the west bank hamas will import weapons and use them to kill israelis . hamas do n't want peace and you can not negotiate with them . they 're not even capable of keeping to a ceasefire for more than 4 hours . the reason why i support israel is because israel is a democratic nation with the fundamental underpinnings of a free society . they are under constant attack by their aggressive neighbours and have no aim but to live in peace in their own country . whatever you say about zionists , the majority of israelis are willing to compromise to live in a safe and secure israel .	cjewjm4	ukpolitics

the area that we know as the dark ages has faced much controversy by historians , and i 'm in the camp that say that it did in fact happen , although we do not know how long for . our language was one of the few things to evolve during this time , which words that originated from the anglo saxons become present which were not used widely or in some cases at all before . although there were some improvements as you rightly say , such as water wheels , great works such as the aqueducts were lost as they did not spread across europe . the phantom time hypothesis is also particularly interesting here , as we have no certain proof if the dark ages and middle ages ever happened , but i would n't say that this was proof . i believe it did happen , but the period of time is unknown to us , as many different things did happen during this time which otherwise could not be explained . thats not too say either of us are right , as it most certainly is a debatable point . my apologies this post does n't really make much sense , the ideas here are hard to articulate well . i believe it happened as its a method of explaining the time period and events that happened , but i may be wrong . it does also help my argument about islam 's contribution to medicine . i think by saying it did n't really happen does n't help explain why these events occurred , and looking at evidence in my opinion suggests it did . it is really a matter of interpretation though , like all things in history !	ck6de36	ukpolitics

oh , fuck 's sake . this again . the issue with the halal debate 's the cognitive dissonance required to see halal slaughter as particularly barbaric '' , when used to end the lives of animals that have been selectively bred for thousands of generations to grow disproportionately fast , with no regard to their health , torn from their mothers almost immediately after birth the mothers being kept in one of the most perfect forms of torture ever devised URL and transferred to similar setups of their own , kept in crates so small that they 're incapable of even turning around for their entire lives , with zero mental or social stimulation , for their entire existence . all the animals raised in a way like that suffer psychological trauma that 'd get someone put before the hague and strung up if it were inflicted on a human being , and at the very least sicken most people to the core were it inflicted on a cat or dog yet , since they 're pigs , cows , turkeys or chickens , and food animals '' , it 's ignored . after living brief , agonising lives of constant torture , the animals are then dragged out to be slaughtered . the humane '' way involves shooting them in the head with a bolt gun , or pushing an electrified rod up their anus and electrocuting them to death . the barbaric '' halal way entails adding a few more minutes onto their life of hell . it 's so fucking precious of people to view halal slaughter as being so significantly more inhumane than normal '' methods of meat production that it warrants this level of moral panic . factory farmed meat production kills billions of animals every year , after putting them through the closest thing to hell that exists on earth URL . the degree of additional suffering inflicted by halal slaughter is so minimal that it scarcely even warrants mentioning . it 's being drummed up into a moral panic because of its connection with muslims . any welfare '' or animal rights '' argument associated with it 's absolute bunk . if the people calling for the practice to be banned really gave the slightest fuck about animal welfare , they 'd boycott factory farms and go vegetarian .	chp2ntw	ukpolitics

my email i am dismayed by this governments plan which looks like succeeding to approve emergency legislation directly opposed to recent eu decision in april that the data retention directive breached the fundamental right to privacy . whilst i appreciate that the ongoing fight against terrorism and international sex offences demands vigilance on the part of government , it has not been demonstrated that the continued , excessive and unlawful retention of data has had real effect on either of these problems . yet again we are sacrificing the key principles of liberal democracy for short term , myopic gain of perceived security . to paraphrase benjamin franklin any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both . to further compound this by tabling it as emergency '' legislation , as if there is some immediate crisis because our security services have been told by the e.u . that they ca n't spy on what mrs miggins ordered on ebay . it smacks of a government that does n't trust it 's own people . it no longer has any faith in real democracy , human rights or rule of law . so slowly but surely it 's abandoning any attempt to even trick us into thinking we live in a liberal democracy . i would hope that you take the time to properly consider the impact of this legislation . it is aimed at lawabiding citizens . i do not buy the argument that i have nothing to fear because i do nothing wrong . democracy requires constant vigilance , one day perhaps even an email message to you like this could be used to indict me . i do not have any expectation that any opposition to this bill will be voiced in parliament .	citic85	ukpolitics

some would . lots would n't . it 's really annoying moving money offshore . it makes it more difficult to access , it is n't in your name , you have to trust the person doing it , and you do n't get that nice and fluffy feeling go doing good towards your fellow man . people are much more willing to do it when they are facing putative levels of tax which are designed to punish the rich than a reasonable and internationally low tax rate . the problem is that we set tax rates that no one is meant to pay because we are incentivising them through isas and other mechanisms to keep the amount people actually pay down to increase spending and investment . when the state does that it gets confusing for people to know how much they are actually meant to pay . say 37 . that is the number . most people would be more likely than if we said 53 . that is the number . because losing more than half of your money before you even start is really effing depressing .	ciud6e6	ukpolitics
objectively , yes . unemployed people and carers are now paying more tax than before the removal of the 'benefit ' , and they are the poorest in society , carers working a minimum of 35 hours a week for 4.70 per hour , 'unemployed ' people on workfare working '37.5 hours a week for 4 per hour . before the tory coalition unemployed people and carers were entitled to council tax benefit , as their incomes were so low they were considered unable to pay , now their incomes have remained the same but their tax burden has been increased , dress it up how you like , but the poorest in society have had their tax burden increased .	cj8fa8k	ukpolitics

1 . 1 nigel farage leader , united kingdom independence party last year we said what a year it has been for ukip leader nigel farage . well , double that for this year . his every utterance is covered by the media quite something for a party leader with no mps and his influence over the conservative party grows by the day . or so it seems . why is he first on this list ? because he is the man who can singlehandedly decide whether david cameron can win a majority in may , and who dominates policy discussions in no 10. tory strategists are desperate to win back party supporters who have defected to ukip and hours are spent answering the question just how will this policy announcement play with the kippers ? farage has a huge opportunity to shaft david cameron on english devolution . and he will enjoy every minute of it . 2 . 1 david cameron prime minister and leader , conservative party another difficult year , but just when you think he might be finished see the scottish referendum he bounces back and grabs the political initiative . however , the backbenches are very restless and any goodwill the prime minister had has gone out the window after botched european elections , a less than perfect reshuffle , his dithering over how to respond to isis and his lamentable failure to take on alex salmond in any meaningful way in scotland . that list could go on . cameron will now be judged on how he delivers english devolution , but his party shouldn t expect much . it s an issue in which he has never shown any interest .	ckwgukn	ukpolitics

how do you campaign against a party like ukip ? one way could be to attract those of the 60 who did n't vote in european elections . a big proportion of that being students who have abandoned the liberal democrats and voting all together it seems . right now all the parties are against students when it comes to tuition and higher education . i think if one the many parties could be more compromising promote student welfare then it would help get there votes up and weaken ukip . most students will probably not support ukip , due to more proeuropean because of traveling and erasmus etc . , slightly more left leaning generally . i am a liberal but would easily vote labour if they promised at least to have a policy of even looking into reducing tuition fees back 3,000 or at least cutting some loans down . not all the neglected blame foreigners , some of us just want to have a voice . students want to have a voice . edit just so i am clear , sorry maybe i did n't come across properly but i meant out of that 60 that did not vote a large proportion were younger student voters and like many used the european elections to not vote as a protest against the parties like the lib dems .	cj1vzns	ukpolitics

fergus wilson may or may not be a cunt but that is immaterial here . he finds himself in a business and he behaves rationally to maximise his income . the true villains of the story are the governments who restricted the building of social housing and sold off the existing stock of social housing for the purpose of increasing private ownership as a method of buying votes and making people more beholden to their employers . we do n't need high speed rail links and we do n't need to build on greenfield sites . we need to redevelop brownfield sites and existing housing needs to be renewed . also we need to redevelop office blocks that have stood mostly empty since they 've been built to maintain the high cost of office space and build social housing there instead . i think the time for compulsory purchase orders to go out against land speculators and office building consortia is long overdue .	clp61mq	ukpolitics

you seem to assume that all labour critics are fans of the tories and viceversa by no means . put simply , the fact that your opponent is equally as incompetent and stupid as yourself , is not defence for reckless actions , and the tories certainly are n't really to blame for much as they did n't actually do the damage themselves merely being guilty to failing to oppose labour in doing said damage . furthermore , the tories would n't have quite the same access to the books as labour , thus might not have quite have appreciated the scale of the problem quite as soon as labour would be able to . this is a rather strange position . we appear to be agreed that neither covered themselves with glory , though we would need further discussion to declare both hopeless incompetents , since as mentioned the precrisis spending plans of labour which the conservatives promised to match were in no particular outstanding or unusual for a postwar government . given that neither party would have averted or even ameliorated the crisis itself or the fallout we experienced , i would rather they both took their medicine the 'fault ' insofar as it belongs with politicians , is shared equally . the specific criticism i have is for the conservatives tendency to rewrite history such that every factor which increased our exposure to the downturn was a machination of labour opposed by the conservatives which is true in no respect , since as mentioned and as can be observed with the help of google and your newspaper of choice , they supported the spending plans in question and urged even more deregulation of the markets . to wit the competence of both is suspect , but to this state we add deliberate mendacity on the part of the conservatives , which is worthy of further criticism .	cn8kqpe	ukpolitics

the study did control for origin characteristics controlled for other factors that could affect earning power , including gender , ethnicity , parents ' education , social class and labour market conditions emphasis mine my claim for students being worse off under a comprehensive system is based on the gap at the bottom of the income scale was most evident among women , with the lowestpaid from grammar school areas earning 87p less per hour than women in comprehensive areas . this is a ceteris paribus comparison . iirc the authors attributed the lack of a male effect to premia for male manual labour which i 'm not convinced is going to be something to be relied on in the future due to various other social trends . also note that labour market outcomes for males at the bottom were not better under selection , they were merely unaffected .	cmrrmww	ukpolitics

that 's a really complex question . i would say that the number needs to be roughly inline with the rate at which we can build new houses , schools , hospitals and other essentials . i have no disagreement there , in principle , so a followup question would be is net migration higher or lower than that figure ? and if so , should migration be brought down or should we change our political structure to enable us to put in place the infrastructure needed to serve all of our citizens and residents ? personally , i would favour the latter . people always point to this . i do n't actually think the majority of people care about eu migration that much . it 's people from north africa and pakistan that they really care about . quite possibly , but this is an area where we can and do impose restrictions on the numbers of immigrants . pakistan and north african countries are n't members of the eu where there is freedom of movement , and most immigration is intraeu migration .	cl93j1r	ukpolitics

taught science is always the result of consensus . here was me thinking that science was a method of discovery , turns out it 's a dogma that needs to be 'taught ' to people . it is very obvious to me that there is simply no conceivable way in which you could ever imagine that you might be wrong about anything , which is an attitude i find to be particularly unappealing . we are already dumping thousands of tons of thorium a year from building solar cells and the costs are dropping year in year out . great , let 's burn every piece of coal in sight if the solar rev is just around the corner . solar feed in tarrifs were scrapped i know . i knew . i already knew this . you admit that companies are willing to set up crazy schemes in order to funnel easy government subsidy money away , and yet you still support subsidies . the evidence is right in front of your face and yet you do n't make the mental leap . if companies would funnel hundreds of thousands of pounds into bogus solar plants designed simply to abuse a government policy , you don't think that companies would do the exact same thing to grab the fucking trillions being offered out for free because of these climate change initiatives ? your naivete is beyond staggering .	ch67edd	ukpolitics

from the point of view of an englishman what makes you think you 're the only ones that think the status quo is something we 're not happy with ? in recent years we 've had a labour government that 's been more conservative than the conservatives , a conservative government that 's done nothing but cause misery and pain to literally millions , a frighteningly ineffectual liberal democrat coalition government that 's achieved ... well ... let 's be honest , nothing in terms of its goals , and no alternative other than a bunch of conservatives that would love to see a return to the good old days of bondage parlour madames and smoking in the pubs or an ultra right wing loon with no real policy other than england uber alles '' . all of this , while the monarchy continues to be bailed out at the taxpayer 's expense . you want change ? fine . let 's talk change . let 's make the republic and actualy republic with an equal voice . let 's abolish this outdated notion that we should be under the yoke of one decrepit woman and her family , and establish some standards and codes of practice that out politicians should adhere to i.e . encouraging people with public interest , as opposed to sociopaths that somewhere along the line decided the politics would be a pretty damned good career to enter into .	cg0ce6s	ukpolitics

how much of the welfare budget do you think is being spent on allowances ? it 's actually a tiny fraction of the overall welfare bill . all things like this do is make unemployment and disability an inescapable trap . it 's difficult enough for the longterm unemployed to get themselves back into work , without having to cope with crippling depression brought about by an insanely strict benefits system . the only reason this is a talking point is to win votes from the uninformed . the people you are thinking about do exist , but they are a minuscule amount of cases . most people on unemployment and disability are n't there for an easy ride , they 're there because something horrible has happened and they have become stuck . if you ever find yourself unlucky enough to be at the jobcenter you 'll find most of the people you see have been laid off . they are n't some rab c nesbit underclass looking to skive off on your dime . you should n't be so hung up on the 0.05p in every pound going on benefits . you should be fucking pissed about the 10p going on defence spending .	ckvycdj	ukpolitics

i 'm quite liberal , although in fact some of my liberal tendencies are arguably authoritarian i believe that where liberty of corporations conflicts with liberty of individuals , liberty of individuals is most important , which implies restricting certain corporate activities . part of the reason why i 'm uncomfortable with banning foxhunting is that i live in a city so the idea of foxhunting is alien and ridiculous to me , but i think people who live in the countryside should be able to make a decision about whether to foxhunt or not . banning foxhunting would neither improve nor worsen my life , but it would impact the lives of some countrydwellers , which is why it should be their decision . i would draw a parallel between the meat process . i enjoy eating meat and probably eat more than is better for my health and the environment , however the idea of butchering animals disgusts me . i am happy to eat meat as long as i do n't have to deal with killing sentient animals that clearly have their own emotional worlds . as a citydweller , that 's not surprising . however in the countryside there are thousands of people whose entire lives revolve around growing animals and slaughtering them in order to meet the needs of people like me who find the entire process disgusting or unethical . so i would say that foxhunting , like butchery and slaughter , seems weird and unethical to someone from a city background , but perhaps entirely normal to someone who spends much of their life around some of the muckier realities of life . if we ban foxhunting , should we also ban abattoirs ?	cycopzf	ukpolitics

wrt land cheapness , the opposite is the case . the more crowded the country is , the higher the land rents . think about it the land in london is much more valuable than the land in , say , lincolnshire . the fact that richer people own land is part of what makes it a progressive tax . removing other taxes would cause rents to rise , which is why it is proposed that you could raise more revenue from lvt if they were gone than with them existing , and with less deadweight loss . there are , however , more nonland rents now than in the past copyright , patents etc and semiland rents like radio spectrum and landing slots etc .	cyh94xe	ukpolitics

whilst that 's mostly right , it ai n't necessarily so , and the largest group after those subject to the negative resolution procedure are not required to be laid before parliament at all , and are therefore not subject to any parliamentary control . when they are , the vote is often a formality since you would n't expect voting mps to be familiar with every sector being regulated and the realworld impacts of changes to regulation , and this is to say nothing of the effect of parliamentary majorities on voting outcomes or the effectiveness of the whip . so there is healthy scrutiny of legislation , given there are some 3k bits of it and only 133 sitting days of parliament into which standing and select committee work also needs to be fitted , but it 's not just minor tinkering as you imply it 's often the most significant place that change can be effected . either way , the original premise that mps only need a day a week to legislate is extremely silly . i was attempting to allude to the volume of work making this impossible to support your point , but you 've taken it in a slightly different direction . hey at least you ended up learning something !	cw4zb75	ukpolitics

of course the only disadvantage it has brought is competition . competition is a symptom of the globalized liberal markets . what we see is the competition is something most young people are use to this is why young people in my mind tend to accept it as part of the opportunities brought by the eu , the older generation tend to worry about it more . competition is absolutely not a drawback . it is extremely important in economics , and should be welcomed wherever it comes up . the older generation worrying about it is like people worrying about trade restrictions being removed , or removal of subsidies none of those should have happened in the first place . removing them or increasing competition lowers prices for everyone .	cwjhzhy	ukpolitics

corbyn is popular among young people because he 's a genuine person not a simulated person , as most of the country 's high profile tvfacing politicians have become . when asked a question , he answers it , he does n't spout the same onmessage sound byte three times then shut down for a recharge cycle . granted , this might be because he 's not expecting to win the leadership race , so does n't have to face the sepctre of quotes coming back to haunt him at the next general election , but maybe as an electorate we 've grown up enough to be able to overlook that kind of tabloid journalism now ? maybe not idk . teenagers are n't cheering him on because he 's very left wing , it 's because he 's a human with genuine human feelings and opinions , and he 's willing to tell people them . at this point , i think literally hitler would do better than cameron , provided he actually seemed like a person .	cteyknp	ukpolitics

there could be an argument that it 's rationality as our tool i.e . the rider that allows us to build those institutions , environments and so on . yes , in fact i 'd probably argue that maybe there 's a positive feedback loop there . rationality builds better environments , which allows us to function more rationally , so we can then figure out how to improve the environment even more and so on . course , it works both ways . places like supermarkets are deliberately constructed to be as cognitively hostile as possible , so as to trick us into making as many bad decisions as possible . there 's a reason why , when you just pop in for milk , you usually have to walk half the way into the shop past all the tasty snackfoods .	cvlvpdo	ukpolitics

the quran can not be changed as it is said to be the literal words of the omniscient , omnipresent and omnibenevolent god and is meant to transcend time and language . so you ca n't argue that it was written in another time '' as most muslims believe the quran is final . isis interprets m malakat aymnukum to mean that they can use nonmuslims as sex slaves . that does n't make them apostates , that is just their take of their faith . so some british muslims may interpret the verse and mohammed 's wives marriage and consumation of aisha at the ages of 6 and 9 respectively to think that rape and forced marriage is acceptable . there is a disproportionately large number of rape , pedophilia and forced marriage underground networks in the asianmuslim british community . you ca n't say religion does not play a part .	cv7wklo	ukpolitics

the worst possible move is to bomb a country then just leave them to it . nah , the worst is to bomb a country , then pick a bribable hardman to be the new leader on the basis that he obeys you even when he murders his own people . see also american involvement in colombiacubahaiti . i think it 's reasonable that we stand by and let other leadersgovernments do their thing up until they start murdering their own citizens . that 's the line and if there 's a viable , democratic opposition big if , then i 'd argue that it 's our responsibility to intervene . in theory i more or less agree , but in reality it looks a lot more messy the usa executes people that we would consider convicted on poor evidence , or below the level of mental capacity to be culpable , and tortures and disregards the geneva conventions besides . we obviously do n't cheer them on , but it 's unlikely that a serious politician anywhere would advocate invading america and instituting a change in government . so any principle of intervention runs headlong into the reality that it will only be used by the more powerful nations of the world on much less powerful nations . and at that point , it 's obviously going to get abused to justify geopolitical games . i would advocate very , very rarely permitting regime change , but greatly strengthen military intervention to create and defend safe zones for victims of a regimecivil warethnic violence . so yes , we invade and prevent atrocities , and likely kick hell out of the local government forces , but rather than attacking militarily , we primarily defend a safe area , and assist people getting there . then the locals who are no longer in immediate danger can work out what government should look like .	cvgqi2t	ukpolitics

in terms of the 'no plan beyond blowing up targets ' , the point is that there is no exit strategy . it does n't matter how orderly and neat the precision strikes are , if we can get a smart bomb straight through the bedroom window of baghdadi , it 's still the case that it 's cutting off a head of a hydra that will sprout more , and probably fiercer , heads . this has been seen in various warzones , iraq postsaddam when it turned out sectarian divisions were rife , libya postgaddafi when it turned out the coalition did n't get along on much else , even egypt postmubarak i can remember as having difficulties fortunately we were n't party to that one . we ended up in afghanistan longer than anticipated but at least we had a working exit strategy to create a credible government and military before leaving . in iraq there was a strategy in place , but this was evidently not effective enough to prevent the rise of daesh . in libya ? enforced a nofly zone , provided further air assistance , then left them to work it out descended into more civil war , country split , people displaced , rape , brutality , extremism . what coherent strategy does cameron have for syria ? he reckons there are 70 000 moderates in there who can do the ground work if only they get a bit more help , but who are they , where are they , and what is their motivation in the conflict ? he wants rid of assad , who even peter hitchens says is the tyrant 'uniquely he cameron wo n't do business with ' , but what plan does he have for after the bombs ? this is crucial it is the most common area where wars are lost .	cxl11n7	ukpolitics

i 'm curious , how did you view the rotherham child abuse . where action was directly hindered due to the ethnicity of the abusers . i viewed it as rather more complex there were indeed failures on the part of the council , partly to do with political correctness oddly enough , seemingly driven by very unpolitically correct views held by some councilllors , so they preferred the minority councillors to look after 'their people 's issues . this hampered the identification of a problem , and they repeatedly failed to hold south yorkshire police to account not due to race , syp simply said they were dealing with it , do n't make a fuss . however , from 2003 onwards , reports had gone to the police and various other bodies actually explicitly stating the problem . the police response appears to have been a campaign of hiding evidence of crime , possibly to the point of collusion with cse perpetrators . for a decade . south yorkshire police were n't just hiding cse , either they were attempting to improve their home office kpis and had a team reclassifying crimes to make things look better . the idea this was a result of nogo zones or sharia law is a stupid suggestion noone was justifying this on religious grounds . if you withdraw law enforcement due to not giving a shit , you will get more kids being abused , regardless of the local ethnic makeup although cultural factors are in play , and undoubtedly influenced the format of abuse in one victim s account , a police officer told her nothing good will come of it . i ve seen your files . you lied about that man all those years ago. he then pulled the police car over and persuaded her to drop the charges against a perpetrator . after ripping up some paperwork , he dropped her off at a restaurant where girls , including victims of cse , and suspected perpetrators used to gather . inspectors wondered if some of this inaction was rooted in the attitudes of some south yorkshire police officers to the victims . they did not seem to believe the girls or their families or those who reported problems . they did not treat them as victims . the girls were blamed for a lot of what happened . it s unbelievable and key to why it wasn t taken seriously as an issue. a police officer there was no awareness . the view was that they were little slags. a key partner farage is a liar , and the reductionist lies hamper building understanding to prevent cse . because fuckwits like yourself parrot his bullshit .	cx34etq	ukpolitics
the conservatives know that labour have n't won an election without scottish mps that 's completely untrue . scotland rarely makes a difference in the outcome of an election . since 1945 , it has only contributed to 2 small majorities to government . even if every single snp seat was labour , the tories would still have a majority . even if blair 's term had every labour seat in scotland turn snp , it would have still been a labour majority . england determines the makeup of the uk government . scotland is an irrelevance .	cxude46	ukpolitics
i 'm not attacking labour i 'm asking why did n't they when everyone seems for it now it 's happened ? why is asking an attack ? i appreciate writing is a lot harder to convey sentiment and the previous commenter seems to prefer a shouting match for some reason . they did do a lot over those years and they did n't do this . tax credits have n't been withdrawn though have they , the systems been altered while also raising the tax threshold so to say they are two policies for the same goal while true negates the fact that they both now exist during a time of the worst economic conditions , so why did n't it happen before when we were booming that was my point ? also tax credits were slammed for being massively over complicated and people frequently getting overpaid and hmrc claiming the money back off the poorest in society . if it was two policies to achieve the same goal raising the level would have been far easier and not backfired on them like it did . and i dont just mean the opposition taking issue , there was some pretty big names in charities and citizen advice criticising tax credits for those reasons . thank you for the response though , the reason i was dismissive of minimum wage as an answer was that minimum wage affects businesses negatively whereas the tax threshold effects the state .	cqeelfm	ukpolitics

if you can get hold of it , just read the little purple book why vote ukip 2015 , published by biteback , one of a series on the main parties in the runup to the ge . here s a sample , the eu is a staggeringly expensive club . it costs us 55m every day to stay in , yet it wastes billions on staffing costs , huge glitzy buildings , vanity projects , foreign junkets for meps , advertising , and moving the whole of the parliament to strasbourg once a month , among other profligacies such as the 140 embassies it has set up in noneu countries 44 diplomats in barbados alone . the eu controls immigration , business and employment , financial services , fishing , farming , law and order , energy and trade . so , whatever the precise figure is regarding how much british legislature is controlled by the eu , you can be sure it is too much . our voting power within the eu is also getting weaker and weaker . those who say if we left the eu we would be isolated and lose our influence are being ridiculous we have very little influence anyway . since 1996 , the uk has voted no to a proposal 55 times at the council of ministerswhere national ministers from each eu country meet to actually decide the eu s line on major issues yet every single time the measure has gone on to become british law anyway. this book details in painful , sleep ruining detail how the eu has damaged our fishing industry , our agriculture , our rights under our legal system , our small and medium sized businesses , our energy policy and costs , our clinical trials , our foreign trade , our patient care within the nhs , and so much else . as the eu expands further , our position within it is going to get weaker and much , much more vulnerable . we must leave while we still have the right to do so .	cq70qii	ukpolitics

i 'm not discussing what 's lawful , i 'm discussing what 's moral . nonsequitur ? in my opinion , it was directly relevant . the additional information i brought in was based on an application under the equalities act . this means the legislation being argued directly influences the facts of the case . unfortunately the equalities act does right and wrong pretty badly . it just says , you ca n't pick on people for w , x and y . '' if z is n't a protected characteristic the act does n't protect you . that does n't make discrimination in respect of quality z any less unacceptable on a moral level . that gets us to here if your description of the story is accurate . . . when a judge makes a finding of fact the determined facts become those on which the decision is based . it 's not unknown for judges to make findings of fact which are plainly wrong . once you have a finding of fact the judgement follows from that . this might seem really odd , but the decision has to be looked at as following circumstances where those facts reflect what really happened , even though it 's feasible they might be inaccurate . so yeah , if what you 've laid out is 'true ' , then my points is moot . i was simply ignorant of the extra details you 've laid out for me . hope i did n't waste too much of anyone 's time . i do n't think it was a waste of time . the bbc reporting of the story was pretty poor quality . although there was an interview to go with it , as a general rule no one goes on tv and admits they did something wrong . if we wanted to all just agree al the time , we could dawdle over to atheism and mumble , religious people are all dumb !

okay , so i 'm learning that my school education was n't as accurate as i thought but i disagree with a couple of points here . first of all , you 're talking about a time where imperialism was very much alive . we live in a very different world today and to suggest you need to start a war or reach a certain kill count before you 're taken seriously is silly . secondly , much of the material nazi germany used to rearm in the early period was sold to them by britain because it was very profitable . they were our best customer for things like steel . we pretty much invited them to rearm . lastly to say germany would have immediately rearmed and gone on the attack in 1953 just like '32 were we not occupying them is not an accurate assumption . germany pursued rearmament so aggressively in the 30s because they were led by rightwing expansionist extremists . it 's not indicative of german culture to be at war all the time .	csunnug	ukpolitics

why are n't they defending mens rights too ? there are already plenty of institutions doing that . one could argue why arent the rspca doing anything about the homeless you ca n't fight every battle and if the battle is being fought better by others , why interfere ? and poc '' do n't exist . there 's something called culture '' which means not everyone who has a similar skin tone , depending on geographic region of birth , upbringing , religion etc . you are correct , because you understand why people are just people . however , your thought patterns are a result of generations of social battles to stop the attitude of separating people based on race and stereotypes . the reason you see a logical inconsistency is because the movements are using language that is already understood by the other side in order to bridge the gap . the language is intended to identify people based on the current social norms , in order to break them . you are not the target , which is why it makes no sense . it does n't to me either , but that 's what it is . poverty issues are actually an issue , but their not a feminist issue , because more men are homeless than women , by a factor of 90 . only 10 of homeless people are women ! that 's a class issue . i 'm not sure the relevance . are you suggesting feminism should tackle homelessness as well , or are you suggesting the fact that they do n't means that all their other work is morally invalid ? go protest saudi arabia 's strict laws on women , or fgm in africa . that sort of stuff , because they 're feminist issues . they do , it happens all the time . it does n't get publicized as much because the status quo over there really do n't like it , and it is n't really aimed at us over here in the uk so it wo n't make the news quite in the same way . it happens all the time though . and do n't call me dumb mra misogynist shitlord '' . i respectfully debated your points , i hope you do the same back . i 'm an egalitarian , and hope for equal rights , for everyone . i am too , but as a white bloke i know and can see the disparity between what i can expect in life , and what others can . that 's not because i am white , per se , but because white people are the dominant majority in this country and the status quo is built for us in order to secure votes and quell unrest . equal rights for everyone means you need to fight harder for those who have it hardest first . that 's why you hear a lot more about black activists or feminists and fuck all about men or white folk . we already have our activists in control of the narrative , even if it does n't match with what we want so we do n't really have as many grievances unique to our situation . almost all issues that affect us as white men also affect men from all other backgrounds , but to a greater degree . when you read all those statistics about suicide rates and employment deaths , i hope you were n't assuming all those men were proportionately white ? they are n't , and a lot of the causes for those numbers could be attributed to issues that we just do n't have to face . that being said , i do n't want to discourage you from the battles . your heart is in the right place and i do understand your frustration . just please understand that feminism is n't the enemy it is painted out to be , and sjws are basically just another bunch of cunts hijacking a good idea for their own smug sense of superiority . pay them no heed .	ctr2x7x	ukpolitics

indeed . a clever interviewer , like neil , would concisely explain the incident including the fact that chuka was clearly an adult 27 when the remarks were posted and the fact they were said on an exclusive network for millionaires . then just ask him to explain , given that context , who exactly were the 'trash ' he was trying to avoid ? i think people are willing to excuse youthful stupidity , but this was only nine years ago in the middle of his adult career outside of politics just four years before he became a labour mp . a neil might also ask what it is about his history as a millionaire lawyer from the city of london that will allow him to relate to the working class people of glasgow and win back their votes ? given that he also grant shapps 'd his own wikipedia page to add the 'british barack obama ' line that is already being pushed on the bbc ... and he received the kiss of death from peter mandleson on andrew marr . it 's going to have to be a hell of a campaign is all i 'm saying . i think the tories would love chuka to be leader of labour almost as much as they would love the milliband mk 2 that andy burnham currently looks like .	cr6th0u	ukpolitics

tl dr type in for proper formatting actual reply for the like you were trying for you need three backslashes , so it should look like this when you type it out which will turn out like this the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy . since the face '' of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face '' this guy . the backslash is reddit 's escape character basically a character used to say that you do n't want to use a special character in order to format , but rather you just want it to display . so your first '' is just saying hey , i do n't want to italicize '' so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it 's just an escape character . after this you still want the arm , so you have to add two more backslashes two , not one , since backslash is an escape character , so you need an escape character for your escape character to display confusing , i know . anyways , i guess that 's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you do n't need to escape the second underscore , read only if you 're super bored or need to fall asleep . edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which does n't have an escape character does n't have another underscore with which to italicize . reddit 's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text , then you put the text you want to format , then you put the character again . for example , you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize . since we put an escape character we have italicize and do n't need to escape the second underscore since there 's not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them . so technically you could have written but you do n't need to since there 's not a second nonescaped underscore . you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break , aka pressed enter twice . if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize . to show you this , you can type italicize and it should not be italicized .	d74ka5k	ukpolitics

that sounds like you 're narrowing the terms of the debate too severely , it 's quite leading . i think it 'd be better to weave it into a broader question about whether parliament should be allowed to debate the objectives , like '' should parliament , as our representatives , be allowed to debate the strategy and objectives of brexit or would doing so damage our negotiating position with the eu27 , as some have claimed ? '' if it were me though i 'd probably make it more about the mandate for any specific goals at all , something like given that neither the referendum nor any manifesto gave a mandate for specific terms of negotiation and the referendum was so close , does this government have the moral right to determine by itself the outcome of such an important and widereaching change in our present arrangements with an impact for decades to come without any further consultation with either the people or even their representatives ? '' or '' regardless of the political and legal ability for them to do so , would it be right according to the principles of our parliamentary democratic system for a government that 's now operating entirely outside of its manifesto commitments to determine the outcome of the most important constitutional change in generations without consultation with the people or their representatives ?

apparently not . also those are adjectives . describing words . is n't that what the labels are ? describing words ? a person could give a long explanation or a short one . a short one is a label . i think people who find themselves at odds with gender norms are n't just having a fashion crisis . i do n't like what is typical for people of my genital configuration . '' where does this place you on trans politics ? does this mean you are strictly true trans '' ? or do you see trans as a spectrum ? great . fantastic . good for you . does n't need a special word to describe exactly how far removed from typical you are . especially not one that needs to be explained to everyone all the time , rendering it less useful than just ... speaking the explanation first . i do n't what 's wrong with having words to explain your sexuality and gender . within a hundred years most of the language we accept about sexuality was invented . the behaviour patterns were there but taboo . i take the view that people want to express gender . people want to express themselves . again , gender is not a synonym for interests or personality . i really think part of the problem here is language . we are putting a lot of categories onto the label gender . when there are distinct but related traits being compressed together . would you accept biological gender and gender expression as two different but recognised traits ? the sexes really are different . of course they are . that 's why we 're able to label things as typically masculine or feminine , because they tend in different directions . but are they different behaviourally ? but we generally ca n't tell someone 's sexuality by what style they dress . we can guess a woman 's sexuality if she is a tomboy . kind of instantly contradicted yourself there . i see what you mean . i 'd qualify my answer . a cultural style does n't tell you a person 's sexuality . a sub culture might . a gendered style is still stronger . what about the well noted tendency of goth girls to be bisexual ? not all cultures have gothdom but all cultures across all time have gnc styles that strongly relate to gay behaviour . are some subcultures more liberal than others ? sure . the rarity of football lovers people wearing a team shirt being gay ? that 's a trickier one as it intersects with class and masculinity . generally working class cultures are less socially liberal . gay behaviour still appears at the same rates but it is often more repressed . intense physical sports are related to masculinity . surely there is a relationship between butch lesbians and sport ? are there masculine gay men into sports ? sure . but i reckon there are less gay men into it than gay men are represented in the population . scene looking dudes being gay ? a subcultures associated with gender non conformity is associated with gay dudes ? does n't that make my point ? i 'm seeing a pattern between gender expression and sexuality here . are you asking me not to see it ?	d7yn8qj	ukpolitics
you could say the exact same thing about catholics or even politicians for that matter ? ... i do n't see why we feel the need to demonise a single religious group when in truth , we need to accept , everyone has corruption , however the small number of corrupt do not reflect the opinion of the majority . hospitals across britain are dealing with at least 15 new cases of female genital mutilation fgm every day . although fgm has been illegal in britain since 1984 , there has not been a single conviction . '' fgm is an issue throughout eastern africa , performed by chrisitans , atheists , pagans and muslims alike . it 's rise is characterised by it being now recognised by healthcare professionals and a growth in immigration from east africa to avoid poverty and terrorism , rather than because of a single religious group . at least 1,400 children were sexually exploited between 1997 and 2013 in the town of rotherham , mostly by muslim gangs , but police and municipal officials failed to tackle the problem because they feared being branded racist '' or islamophobic . '' this is an issue of political tolerance gone too far , i agree . what happened in rotherham is disgusting without a doubt and talking to some people from a local mosque , they agree with me . it 's not a case of all muslims being prepared to do these kind of things when most condemn it . i should also reiterate , that sex trafficking has happened in various groups , not solely islam , for example , there was a known ring within the bbc , but we do n't attack that organisation for it , as it would be illogical to blame a majority for a terrible act carried out by a small minority . reverend giles goddard , vicar of st john 's in waterloo , central london , allowed a full muslim prayer service to be held in his church . he also asked his congregation to praise the god that we love , allah . '' i do n't see the issue with this ? ... surely it 's just a good show of religious tolerance . you should note , christianity and islam are both abrahamic religions , i.e they both worship the same deity , hence it makes sense for them to cooperate . there has been a 60 increase in child sexual abuse reported to the police over the past four years , according to official figures . '' and this is related to islam how ? ... this is a good thing as in the number of reports rising , it shows that child sex abuse is not something we will tolerate and with more reports , the police are in a better position to act to stop it . british intelligence are monitoring more than 3,000 homegrown islamist extremists willing to carry out attacks in britain . '' and british intelligence also suggests that a large catholic movement , known as the ira , poses a greater security threat in northern ireland than any other . yet there is no article suggesting that the catholicization of britain is an issue , as it is n't . this is a tiny minority of 3.5 million , roughly 11200 so i hardly see why it 's a relevant figure compared . as stated before , you ca n't take the actions of a minority to blame a massive majority . a muslim worker at a nuclear power plant in west kilbride , scotland , was removed from the premises after he was caught studying bombmaking materials while on the job . '' annd ? ... URL radicalisation happens in all groups ... i may as well say it again you ca n't take the actions of a minority to blame a massive majority . '' we try to avoid describing anyone as a terrorist or an act as being terrorist . '' tarik kafala , the head of bbc arabic . '' surely that 's a logical position to take ? ... bbc arabic works in areas , especially in the middle east , where tensions between multiple religious and ethnic groups are in conflict , surely it makes sense to avoid people who are likely to perpetrate terrorism , i fail to see how this at all shows anything about the islamization of britain '' ? ... this article is a perfect example of bad press , it 's attempting to stereotype 3.5 million people for the actions of a very small minority of less than 3,500. quite simply put , as much as i agree that we need to talk about the cultural integration of uk muslims , this is not the way to do it ...	cyi7l55	ukpolitics

free speech comes with responsibilities , and i do n't believe that the daily mail takes responsibility for the shit it spreads not least because the owners and decisionmakers at the mail are people who will always be very far removed from the consequences of their actions . targeting the advertisers is one of the few ways to actually hurt those people . if i went round my place of work being a massive bigoted twat to people all the time i 'd expect to face consequences as a result , and i do n't imagine my hr department would consider free speech a particularly good defence of that . so i do n't want to prevent the daily mail from saying whatever it wants , but i want it to be accountable for the words that it publishes because the greatest threat of all to freedom of speech is from those who abuse that right without facing any consequence in doing so .	daf7sh2	ukpolitics

even in the polling disasters of may 2015 , april 1992 and june 1970 the polls were wrong by a handful of percentage points . in a first past the post , twoandabit party system , that margin of error is enough to produce widespread egg on face for pollsters . but it does also mean that even at their worst , polls have been accurate enough to distinguish between , for example , parties languishing in the low thirties or soaring up to the upper forties . especially as there is a pattern to the errors . when the polls get it wrong , they usually overestimate labour support , and when they get it badly wrong , they ve always overestimated labour s support . knowing that pattern and the level of accuracy with which polling can reasonably be interpreted , there is therefore still plenty of knowledge to be gleaned from voting intention figures .	cymrrqa	ukpolitics

defying the whip for literally three and a half decades , attacking the leaders , attacking party policy , not even voting for said policy in his time as leadership . i m honestly not really not why anyone thought the plp would , or should , follow him . leaving aside his dire leadership skills , he hasn t played ball for a long time , everybody else has had to fall in line from time to time , they can t agree on all policy points , but to an extent they still have to toe the line if the party wants to get anything done . probably every politician has had to compromise , corbyn wont achieve anything if he continues being so obstinate .	d5n4amq	ukpolitics

ok , the entering into of a trade treaty , or any treaty , is the joint agreement to limit the behaviour of the individual parties in some way for hopefully mutual benefit . thats a surrendering of sovereignty . the only country that does not do that is north korea , not a model i think we should emulate ... right now , we have surrendered sovereignty to the eu ... for mutual benefit . we can take that back , but if we just turn around and enter into trade treaties with everyone else , we just give it up again ... people dont give you things for nothing .	d3au1vq	ukpolitics
the eu must not let britain profit from leaving the bloc as that could inspire other states to follow suit , european council president donald tusk said , echoing other policymakers in signalling a tough stance in upcoming brexit negotiations . it sounds like it 's willing to fuck over any member state to preserve the eu body , yet the eu is supposed to serve its members . regardless , if it wants to play the part of evil dictator it may . that would only hasten its destruction by proving it has n't learned . trying to punish a nation for enacting a democratic vote and obeying the will of the people is quite revealing .	d5akj3y	ukpolitics

i accept that some people wo n't be happy with such a coalition initially , but as i said if the government is successful why would people still be annoyed ? they go into coalition , the world does n't end , there are no unreasonable demands given into the snp . of course if the above does n't happen and it 's seen in a negative light it will harm them as i said , but labour is very much in control of that . if the snp make unreasonable demands just do n't go into coalition , you have n't lost anything by trying . i could see many reasonable demands labour could give into the snp that would be good for scotland for instance on further devolution . it 's not like they do n't have anything to offer . this could also help keep scotland in the union and would n't harm england or any of the other regions . this lie from the remain campaign needs to die , this inevitable path '' is n't supported by any polling data whatsoever . scotland favours staying ergo leaving would anger scottish voters . i admit it 's not necessarily inevitable '' though . i just find it amusing you could talk about potential constitutional issues that could arise under a labour government all the while the conservative party have potentially led us out of the eu . you realise as a brexiter you 're essentially the equivalent of the snp in this debate right ? i mean alright the eu is n't exactly the same as the uk , but the situation is similar . you probably do n't see it that way though .	d496tku	ukpolitics

how about i as an atheist decide if it 's wrong to preach about jesus in the street ? how about we start arresting people who preach near me , since i 'm offended by their words . is there an epidemic of street preachers sexually assaulting atheists ? no ? ok then , conversation over . you do n't seem to be able to fundamentally grasp the problem at hand here . you seem intent on framing street harassment as women being offended '' . no , it 's women being fucking assaulted and the threat of it happening . no , and harassing people in the street does n't include saying single passing and objectively unoffensive comments '' objectively unoffensive comments '' . as decided by who ? you ? you seem desperate to paint your subjective opinion as objectively unoffensive '' . maybe because you know there 's nothing to support that . it 's just your opinion . and you do n't get to tell women that they should n't feel threatened when 4 of them have been sexually molested in a public place by people like this . it 's funny , since that link you posted does n't show a single person claiming the intent was to make the woman uncomfortable . the article alongside the video lists to appear macho within a group of friends , to exercise one s right to free speech , and to express attraction '' . so what you 're saying is that your claim that there 's a direct intent to make women feel uncomfortable '' is complete and utter bull . to appear macho within a group of friends by making a woman feel uncomfortable , huh ? to exercise one 's right to free speech by using that speech to make women feel uncomfortable , huh ? to express attraction even when women are telling you that it makes them feel uncomfortable , huh ? you seem to think that intent is everything . i did n't intend to make her feel uncomfortable by yelling that she had nice tits , so why would she be ? '' your complete disregard for what other people tell you is noted . and subsequently thrown on the rubbish heap . i 'm happy to listen , um ... you 've just spent several paragraphs expressing how much you do n't think street harassment is a problem and that it 's just compliments '' and it 's about women just being offended '' . now you claim you 're happy to listen ? smh . no , but that 's what you are actually saying . you 've stated that catcalling invariably leads to sexual assault , that men never get catcalled and that women never assault men . i 've stated that catcalling can lead to sexual assault , because it does URL . i 've stated that men rarely get catcalled , because they do n't and i 've asked you to provide evidence that they do and you 've brushed that off . was it you who tried to claim that it was people like me '' who covered up all the evidence ? hard to remember at this point . and i 've said that women do n't assault men in public places , because they do n't . and if they did , you would be able to show me some evidence of such . i 'm sorry that you find factual information disturbing , but we ca n't just pretend the world is different to how it is just to make you happy . come out from under the bed and read the data on street harassment . i 'm happy to provide it . again , my problem with that is no legal ruling should apply to only one gender . which is why you 're spending so many paragraphs telling me that street harassment is n't a problem anyway ? holy shit bro .	d5bwr04	ukpolitics

i disagree that there is a marxian materialist dialectic going on . there are those , quite obviously , who do see it as a raceclassgender war however i doubt that many who subscribe to intersectionality are into that kind of thing indeed , andersen and hill collins ' race , class , and gender an anthology is where intersectionality , in its modern guise , comes from and all it professes is something of a victim complex . they want more of a microobservation on the various social strata and , in extreme cases , substrata that exist . it is like the sociological symbolic interactionism but rather than cohesion they see a conflict . the conflict is different from the marxist variant in that it is not intrinsically tied to capitalism . nor is it wholly material . instead it focuses on the cultural and , oddly , the spiritual . for an intersectionist ? the body does not seem to matter as much as the mind that is inside it . there is differences between the races but it is not a physical difference it is one of identity , one that is within , built by the perceived plight and conflict which someone from a minority racial background comes from . however , this is where the thing falls flat . not every single member of a minority group has seen this kind of conflict . neither is every single member of the majority guilty '' of perpetuating the conflict . it would be daft to say so . you are correct that it all ends in a fragmented lumping together of people . yet identity politics , in different guises , has been around for much longer . the left is based upon the idea that the proletariat is at odds with the bourgeoisie . that has been the leftward position for well over a century . note that labour tends toward higher corporation tax and whatnot to redistribute that amongst everyone else . this has its foundation in class conflict and that the proletariat has to develop its own identity , shunning the false one perpetuated by the bourgeoisie . for liberalism the individual is not atomistic out of all the people i thought i would paraphrase murray rothbard was not one of them but works within a group for the benefit of themselves and the others around them . they , as an individual , have rights that protect them that being a womanhomosexualblackworking class should not be a barrier to attainment or a good life hence the liberal democrat preamble the liberal democrats exist to build and safeguard a fair , free and open society , in which we seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty , equality and community , and in which no one shall be enslaved by poverty , ignorance or conformity the last one , conformity , is within the confines of identity politics . liberalism and its love of the individual has had identity be a part of its make up for quite a while . i do agree that too much identity politics is bad but to blame everything on the ideas behind it is a bit far in my view .	dane6th	ukpolitics

holy shit i 'm not a strong eurosceptic by an means but what utter shit . the last time the british public voted on the eu it was the eec and was only an economic union . since then there 's been 4 major treaties transferring large swathes of power to the eu that not a single british voter voted for . it 's pretty clear that politicians can integrate us at will without the public 's approval . the eu is a wholly undemocratic organisation and i certainly do not trust them to not try and force further integration .	czus79x	ukpolitics

well , even without the 28 national parliaments , the european council requires unanimuos votes for most decisions . therefore , most contracts will have the signature of cameron , brown or blair on it . also , being part of the eu parliament , uk had its chance to influence the whole contract . it does not matter if they succeed in the voting the decision has to be carried jointly by all see remainers . as part of the eu , the uk carried jointly all contracts . getting rid of these obligations will not be cheap . the precise number is yet unknown , because all contracts of the last 40 years have to be evaluated onebyone . first estimates are 4060 billion eur .	da1e0uj	ukpolitics
the problem there is you can lead a horse to water but you ca n't make it drink . our city library is devoid of people that would probably most benefit from using it . the majority of people that are using it would provide their children with ample reading material anyway . it 's hard to justify a service that 's not providing a measurable benefit over what would happen anyway . what does seem to be somewhat effective is libraries reading rooms in schools . kids are basically pressed into getting out a book to read . i do n't know if they read them but i at least see them all running around holding a book . btw , i 'm broadly in favour of keeping libraries open but we need to work much harder at getting people into them .	d6mxq3p	ukpolitics

i think it might be the whole how the society treats sex offenders . in many of these countries rape in marriage is ignored . rape of girls in general depends on the social status of the goal , much the same way as that 70s style oh but she was dressed in a manner asking for it the rationale is that if she was a good girl her family would n't be allowing her to be in a situation like that . when you consider that if the girl 's family had any power , and chance of bringing comeuppance upon the rapist , the girl would n't have been allowed to be dressed like that , to be out in public unescorted etc . it 's a you need a western education '' at all , people learn from consequences , from other people in their societies mistakes and what they can get away with . most people speed on the motorway , do 7580 , which despite being illegal is seldom enforced , so on plenty of stretches of road everyone does it .	d5zd24x	ukpolitics

nevertheless it is fascinating that when it came down to it jeremy corbyn just like david cameron , theresa may , sajid javid et al decided to put his own political career ahead of his own principles or the interests of his country . still , at least it closes one debate . many people who voted to make jeremy corbyn the labour party leader argued that although he may be a bit dishevelled , a tad disorganised , and so on , he is at least authentic and principled . this week simply provided further proof that he is just a disorganised man with dishevelled principles . '' i am not imposing leadership lines . i do n't believe anyone has a monopoly on wisdom we all have ideas and a vision of how things can be better , '' he said . i want open debate , i will listen to everyone , i firmly believe leadership is listening .

no . but it 's simple . they have ties with our nation . they want a deal with us asap . they ca n't have a deal with just us . they have to have one with the eu . the eu negotiates on behalf of every state . so the deal takes ages to negotiate . despite what some would have people believe , deals between individual nations are much simpler than between a nation and a bloc , etc . you can look at all the papers you want . just like how you can read about how to swim . until you get in the water you do n't know if you can . your type is common . never sold a thing in their life and thinks that academic papers will reveal how trade and supply and demand works . there are countries , most notably in africa and india that have different growing economies to us . they want to sell things to us and we buy from them that are different to what we sell to them and they buy from us . which makes for the best kind of trade partner .	cyq6rww	ukpolitics

this sub won t really find this interesting , more of a macro article . but let s just think about this when the us stopped qe , it didn t inherently cause bond yields to rise , because the reinvestment continued i.e . the level of the feds balance sheet stayed the same . in fact , we saw in 2016 , we actually saw the record lows of this cycle during the oil price decline and the china brexit fears . so i m not sure about this article s premise . all this tells me is that the rate of bond buying isn t going to be increasing but the actual quantity of the ecb s balance sheet will remain in tact since they re not going to pursue quantitative tightening like the us yet . so if we re taking that into consideration , and all this information is already well known by markets , almost all of it has been priced in thus actually not affecting sterling . in fact you could argue that all that will happen next year is that rate differences between the u.k. and german , french bonds etc will increase as the boe hikes further . oh and by the way , in my analysis i ve gone as far as them stopping increasing the size of their balance sheet completely as opposed to just reducing the rate of increase as oxford looks at . personally i think they re behind the curve with their analysis .	drdyyl6	ukpolitics

the saudis also sponsor and propagate sunni wahhabism , the very foundation on which isis ' ideology is based , around the world . you 're not wrong that it 's a rather toxic form of islam in its fundamentalism . still , it takes a leap outside of wahhabism to find yourself in isis territory . while wahhabis are very strict in their interpretation of the holy texts , the core message is still one largely of tolerance . isis is most accurately described as a cult that has splintered away from extremist islam , rather than an extension of any part of it . they passed wahhabism on their way out , but they are n't really connected . the only connection that can be drawn is that the growth of wahhabism is gradually pulling some muslims out of mainstream discourse and social life . that fosters the kinds of conditions in which vulnerable people can find themselves drawn to more extreme ideologies .	dfu3pgr	ukpolitics

so many euros are held in london that if euro clearing was banned then these euros would just get traded between london institutions on an entirely new market outside eu jurisdiction . traders would prefer this market because it is not backed by the ecb , is therefore riskier , and therefore attracts a higher interest rate . much the same happened decades ago when lots of dollars were floating around london . traders invented the eurodollar market in this way . by and by it became one of the globe 's greatest sources of investment and so powerful that it could destabilise the us dollar itself . and the us dollar is considerably less vulnerable than the euro . the eu 's problem is that british financial services play a systemic role in the functioning of the eu 's economy . that ca n't be rescinded by a simple regulation .	dmn58vm	ukpolitics

you have not , in fact , shown that the iraqi situation was necessarily going to be worse . which is what you need to prove . crucially , you did not show britain intervening with the us was certainly be worse than the usa alone . i 've not got to prove '' anything . as you well know , it 's impossible to prove absolutely that an actual outcome was better or worse than the counterfactual . what i can do is point out how unlikely it was that it was going to end well . otherwise your argument is merely that intervention was incautious . which it was , certainly , but that 's not the point . how is that not the point ? a war , fought based on a lie , had little chance of improving the overall situation either in the region or the wider global situation . we can all see the consequences of that decision right now . it was a stupid and irresponsible decision when it was made and nothing that 's happened since has suggested otherwise . of course , as i 've said , it 's impossible to prove that the world is 100 definitely worse than if the war had n't happened , but it 's it not hard to demonstrate that it 's highly likely to be the case . your arguments are also flaky , because they are based on knowing things which could not be known then that iraq had been fundamentally disarmed of wmds ? that it was a powder keg of different groups likely to turn violent against each other and any invaders the second that the hussain regime fell ? are you seriously trying to suggest that people did n't know , or at least have a very high level of confidence , about those things before the invasion ? and the consequences you harp the most about came from 911 they started then . but it got a lot worse after the iraq war . the huge increase in terrorism in the middle east or are you not caring about iraqis ? , the responses to the terror attacks in the uk which have been used to justify all manner of civil liberties attacks , and police cuts elsewhere , the rise of isis and the war in syria , leading to much of the refugee crisis across europe , and the emboldenment of the extreme right in response that crisis . all of those things have happened since the war and all have a pretty straight line taking them straight back to it . apparently you believe that crap about removing your shoes at airports for security 's sake ! and back to making up things to argue against when i 've already stated the exact opposite ? what exactly do you think you 're achieving with that ?	drdqis8	ukpolitics

i do n't doubt there 'll be more extreme crashes like the 90 dips there have been in the past , but corrections are just a part of crypto and a useful way to combat artificially inflating value by just hodling . right now btc is awful at being used as an actual currency with insane tx fees and waiting times , so until either segwit 2x or lightning network is adopted by the major players it 's just going to be seen as an investment '' instead of what it was meant to be imo . monero is interesting , it 'll never be a top 3 crypto because of scalability issues , but it seems to be the most privacy focused crypto out there atm and it 's steadily rising in value , in fact i think it 's being helped by the current issues bitcoin is having ! i like bitcoin cash but there 's only so far it 'll get by piggybacking the bitcoin brand i 'll sell when it hits that point !	dr4rwni	ukpolitics
labour , but on local lines . the lad who 's standing in my constituency which used to be a marginal but is now pretty safe blue is a local fella who literally wants to go into politics to help the local area . i 've had chats with him and he 's not interested in standing in or representing anywhere else . he 's in it all for the right reasons and would spend a lot of time actually in the town , unlike the current troy who has been embroiled in expenses scandals in the past and has been our mp for almost 20 fucking years . do n't get me wrong , i think disaster is coming whoever the next pm is , and neither of the parties has the answers for the issues we face on a national level , so the least i can do is try and have someone to represent me in westminster who i can at least approach and who at the very minium will try to put our interests first . plus he said he 'd give me a job on his team if he wins .	diko3ro	ukpolitics

actually i have't really seen anyone justify why population growth was too high . it 's based on 'feelings ' rather than justifiable data in my experience that 's the case on both sides though , ultimately it will come down to feelings and whatever data is presented most people have their mind already made up . to pick one example though , i would say the rate of household formation being far higher than the number of new homes built is reason enough to want to see immigration tempered . to which the response is usually along the lines of 'this is the fault of government policy , sufficient houses should be built ' but that is a long term fix , politically hard to implement and unlikely to happen , we should n't discount the extra pressures posed by a growing population because in a perfect world the government would be competent enough to meet it .	dqjyevq	ukpolitics

contrived nonsense . it was theatre and his resignation meant nothing as there were no negative consequences for it . of course there were , it was all over the press and highlighted the issue . we 'd still be leaving the eu if he was n't in his post but he 's in a position to shape it . christ , if you have a particular political interest and you 've got the opportunity to shape its outcome , would n't you go for it ? of course you would . you expect him to throw his hands up and say 'sorry , i 'm not having anything to do with this despite it being a core belief of mine , i 'm just going to sit and watch ' ? why are you so desperate to drill in something about career motivation ? he refused his first offer of a shadow cabinet position in the 90s and refused a ministerial position under cameron .	dfe10nt	ukpolitics
well , there 's a few metrics you can look at such as comparing the average living standards , expendable income , income inequality etc . if there 's no significant change or actual improvement then i 'd say it 's a success , if there 's significant change for the worse in manymost of these then i 'd say it 's a failure . everyone will decide for themselves , of course , but if the majority 's living standards get squeezed then i 'd be willing to wager the public opinion will turn against it , as well . the uk already is the most inequal society in europe in terms of income , it does n't really have much room for failure in that regard before you start having real societal issues . i hope for the best but i just ca n't see how a tory driven brexit would bring about noticeable improvement in the average citizen 's life .	dfjubn9	ukpolitics
legal confusions have been a problem . eu human rights law has been a disaster zone for a long time . large numbers of the rights are completely worthless . read it , it 's amazing . a socalled right '' will typically have lots of caveats like , you have a right to life ... except the government can still execute people . there is a right to not be tortured ... but for the longest time , sleep deprivation was not considered torture . there is a right to not be made a slave or subject to forced labour ... unless it is considered to be a part of a person 's normal civic duties '' . you have the right to liberty ... except for when you 're arrested . best of all , you have a right to privacy ... except for when not having that privacy is necessary in a democratic society '' . essentially every right is caveated with language that lets the government overrule the socalled right whenever it feels like ... which is not what rights are meant to be about . the us bill of rights is thus a far superior document , as it leaves congress with far less wiggle room to get out of things . the result of this is that judges have routinely reached contradictory or mutually exclusive judgements on what the rights '' actually mean . legal confusion is n't a rare occurrence with these laws , it 's the norm .	dq7clan	ukpolitics

how does this have anything to do with liberalisation of employment ? if people wanted to pay more for goods and services then employers could pay their staff considerably more money . even if you argue they would n't , it could be obtained through taxation . the problem is no one wants to pay more for the commodities businesses rely on to turn a profit . if paying employees a better wage was good for the economy , why have most of our manufacturing and all our heavy industries been moved overseas to locations like china and india where the labour costs are the lowest in the world ?	dwbk6md	ukpolitics

well plenty of people actually do n't know . and if it 's patronising that is n't the same as victim blaming . i visited a uni campus the other day and there are many signs warning students about locking their bikes up with any lock other than a dlock . it 's good advice , a lot of people do n't realise how easy it is to cut a cable lock . is this victim blaming too ? it is telling women that they must curtail their freedom because men ca n't be expected to control themselves . if that 's the message you get thaen you re very immature , you probably need the advice .	e4ig100	ukpolitics

the issue is that the cis '' label use is driven by , predominantly , people outside of the group that the word cis '' would apply to . that 's where the problem arises . if a group of people want to call themselves something then great . if they then insist on other people not in their group calling themselves something and they see no problem with that , then that 's a bit odd . the whole premise of this in the context of gender identity is a bit incongruous as well . the argument is often presented as that gender as an identity is a fluid term , that can be at the most extreme example of this argument entirely self determined by the individual at any point to any extreme . therefore the term cis should be meaningless , as the relationship between your sex and your gender is irrelevant . i mean , make your mind up , people . it 's hard enough not to offend people at the best of times . let alone when the rules keep changing and are contradict each other .	easmks8	ukpolitics
come to think of it number 1 and number 2 are too close to each other as number 3 and number 4. though hard brexit focuses on issues other than immigration . perhaps a better question should be a binary choice between hard and soft brexit . though the questions that you outlined is akin to a second referendum with more choices .	e6ukapd	ukpolitics

my favourite part of this tactic is that it 's done in full knowledge of the fact that the current labour leadership are almost defined by opposition to the new labour regime . which means you can reword but under the previous government '' to but those people you also strongly disagree with '' ... does n't quite have the same ring to it , though . and it would betray the fact that politics is more complex than side a vs side b , even in the uk 's wouldbeshouldbe twoparty system . note and slightly tangential rant the political system in britain is set up the way it is in order to provide a stable , predictable system of governance that moderates the democratic expression of the people . it is modeled so that voters will enter into a pattern of pivoting back and forth between two parties , with any other parties as mere minor inconveniences . but this assumes two things 1 , that voters will be universally or even majority rational , and 2 , that voters will not see through this and use their vote to rebel . now voters are not , have never been , and will never be universally rational , and at the same time they are n't stupid they do see through this . and that 's why , periodically , you get upheavals with old stalwart parties falling off the map and new ones entering the fray , and those upheavals get increasingly chaotic . the system breaks itself apart over time , because it demands to contain what can not be contained .	du0ce0u	ukpolitics

that 's part survival strategy . councils were for a long time labour strongholds , and basically run like private fiefdoms because people in scotland would vote for anyone wearing a red rossette , with benefits being parceled out to friends . glasgow is a prime example of the corruption involved . when westminster austerity hit , it also hit the scottish budget through the bernett formula , forcing the snp government to consider cuts . the scottish government could not borrow money , so options were limited . the solution to both these problems was rather sneaky but capable centralize institutions away from the councils , starting with the police , and leave council to borrow instead of the government . the centralization lowered costs , removed labour influence from them , and allowed borrowing with councils acting as intermediaries . services stayed roughly the same , budget was freed , and austerity dodged which allowed for more sociallycentric policies . the heavily labour and conservative councils took direct offense at all of this and left cosla , out of some weird idea to do their own thing regarding negotiations with the scottish government . but have apparently fallen into line since they are a useless bunch of prats .	egx74k3	ukpolitics

the greens stance on economics and defence is further to the left than labour . and their anti nuclear stance is what makes me wary about them along with their aforementioned defence stance . i could see that changing in the next general election though . so far they have been the party of the left protest vote . with these polling percentages they might moderate some of their stances to be a viable competition for labour and the student vote . the two main parties especially the tories , who were the only major party on the right for decades have gotten away with so much because of the fact that they were the only major ones for much of the last century . this can change .	er57v8s	ukpolitics

' the argument that others are just as propagandist is an implicit agreement that this is propagandist . i 'm arguing that what they are all doing is not propaganda . it is showing that this is the behaviour of normal journalism . if you want to call all opinion propaganda then you can , but nothing i have written can be seen as endorsing that view . there is a substantial difference between the article , which argues that boris just needs a few seats to win , and curtice , who points out that a few seats will decide the election . there is a difference of perspective . nothing more . they are looking at the issue from the perspective of what would boris need to do to win . that does n't misrepresent what curtice said at all . the point remains the same , the relevance of the point is all that changes . your arguments for this article being propaganda are actually laughable . you can only reach your conclusions by treating all opinion as propaganda . not only that but you 've also stated several things which are flat out wrong such as the quotes implying the flaws of fptp being 'rare ' or that the opinion is based on expert opinion . you are right about one thing , thinking i 'd believe you for a second does insult my intelligence .	f8s8u1t	ukpolitics

these are n't people interacting with other ethnicities though . they must be experiencing other ethnicities to a degree . notably higher than other places in the uk . luton , if anything , has become more european in recent years as the ethniccultural change happened decades ago and has long since plateaued . i 'm not sure what you are saying . tr comes from a background with experience of different communities . if you look at the bnp councillor results they are in areas adjacent to areas of migration . they are not from areas exclusively neighbouring white british areas . it does n't seem controversial to see ethno nationalism to be reactive politics . this is the halo effect . a bigger question is , does diversity mean people , all people , become more focused on ethniccultural identity in politics ? the recent surge there has been in eastern european migration and that 's largely displaced the asian population when you look at where they 've moved to . tommy robinson is a single case as well , the edl largely get their support and membership from exclusively white areas . the contact hypothesis is backed up by plenty of research and uk specific research as well . i do n't the contact hypothesis is proven at all . i think it 's still disputed within social science . there seems to be plenty of evidence against . yugoslavia had years of contact , years of shared lives but when the politics and economics turned , the country split up on ethnic lines . all that contact did n't stop that . sure contact can help , but it does n't seem to help enough . as long as people are ethnically divided they will continue to act upon it . it does create more difficult politics . this is only interesting if you 're claiming they vote for brexit in similar ratios to white brits in the countryside . just saying a lot of white brits in london voted brexit is n't useful without comparison . brexit was driven by a number of things . i do think rapid ethnic change '' was probably one of them . i do n't believe it when a brexiteer talks about eu rules on bendy bananas . '' and again i would question the model that says absolute diversity means optimal results . the paradox of diverse communities URL e.g. ? the evidence shows more ethnically diverse areas where people actually interact with other ethnicities are more tolerant . people are less likely to buy into xenophobia or stories peddling this . right but there 's issues with that . people tend to cluster around their ethnic identity . this is a well known phenomena replicated across the world and in different cultures . people in the diverse areas are more tolerant . but diverse areas are not stable and the separation of communities occurs . the pattern of separation is well known as demonstrated in this online game . URL obviously we can manufacture a scenario where diversity is contrary to oneall of these but in practice immigrants are n't contrary to these at all . if you 're going to claim otherwise , you 're going to have to credibly evidence it . i can agree four conditions under which intergroup contact will reduce prejudice are equal status , common goals , intergroup cooperation , support of authorities , law or customs . '' i can see that those conditions really do help cohesion . but when we have increasing inequality it 's going to go against that . and cultural diversity by it 's nature is going to mean , different goals and different customs . i ca n't not see that . shared customs are how people get along . i 'm not getting involved in a hypothetical political model , you 're moving this now towards a direction of idealistic framework vs. common sense '' this is n't an argument i 'm interested in . fair enough . but we have to model how we thinks things will turn out . my view comes from a very pragmatic , observable position rather than the antiimmigration position which essentially views almost every problem related to diversityimmigration itself and by extension , the problem is the existence of immigrants in large numbers . i 've never been convinced by this . you 're saying the numbers are n't an issue . does this mean you are for open borders ? whatever the benefits of diversity i think it can increase political complications and ethno nationalism .	es082vt	ukpolitics

this is just factually wrong . you 've pulled it from your arse . no , it isnt . the ussr had to import food from the us in massive amounts until the mid to late 1960 's at the very least because their belief in lysenkoism led to constant food shortages and famines . while there was a foodshortage in the early years , that 's not surprising and not because of socialism . wrong and wrong . the ussr had massive amounts of farmland . collectivisation and general socialist bullshittery combined with their belief in lysenkoism led to massive crop failures , famine and starvation . but because it was a fuedal country where harvesting was still done by hand . and had just suffered 2 devastating wars crippling the nation . mass mechanisation occurred during and after the war . and this issue still continued until the 60 's , do dont try blaming it on handharvesting . collectivisation ... rapidly modernised agriculture and vastly improved food security and material conditions for the people . citation needed . industrialisation , yes , after the us and britain sent huge amounts of industrial equipment and supplies to the ussr during ww2 . but you will need to provide some solid fucking evidence to prove collectivisation improved crop yeilds and agriculture in the ussr . even though the blackbook is silly propaganda except ... it isnt . whilst some of the authors disputed some of the numbers in the book and distanced themselves from it somewhat , they have stated that the overwhelming majority of the figures are correct . there are also many , many other sources that the ussr alone killed tens of millions of its own people , on top of atrocities like the holodomor . stop swallowing the socialist propaganda . its pretty easy to prove that capitalism kills more people every 10 years . then do it . provide the sources . i bet you wont , because it doesnt .	eldwo7m	ukpolitics

ok , i will attempt to give you the complete story . i am retired on a modest pension after working for social services for 37 years . i have been a floating voter all my life , and my roots are pure working class . born in grandparents council house because very young parents were too poor to afford own home . career long union member . nupe steward , nalgo , unison . now i am a card carrying conservative whom today proudly posted his ballot for boris johnson . the main reason is very simple . within my life experience , the labour party have fucked up the economy time and time again . during the 'winter of discontent ' , rubbish was piled high in the streets , overrun with rats , corpses were not collected , the economy went into a roller coaster descent . i revised for my olevels by candlelight as the 3day week cut the power . so much for the abuse of trade union power . corbyn would take us back to those days . margaret thatcher built more council houses in one year than tony blair did in his entire reign . we need to recognise that it is nearly 2020. the national and global economies are far more complex than even 20years ago , and there is no going backwards . i sincerely believe , as everything in my life has indicated , that free market enterprise produces by far the best results for the greatest number of people . in fact , during the last 30 years , it has raised billions of people all over the globe out of poverty into a comfortable living environment . just look at china and india . i have read that either of their middle classes are now larger than those of usa and eu combined . no surprise that the tiger economies are so important . no system is perfect , and of course the tories have their faults , they seem to favour the ultra rich and privileged . but just look at our economy . the highest rate of employment since 1973. wages are pushing up steadily . interest rates are low , maybe too low . our push for renewable energy and clean transport has the potential to unleash a wave of new jobs , wage rises , tax cuts , government money and hopefully prudent investment in our infrastructure . they obviously need to slash stamp duty , give the elderly tax breaks to downsize property , and build several million new homes on quality brownfield and reassigned greenbelt land . but it can be done . brexit will , after the initial bump , usher in a new era of global trading , low tax and light regulation which will breathe fire into our already world class tech sector and financial sector . we will import masses of food goods from the emerging african economies that are currently held back by the common external tariff . the price of food , clothes and shoes especially childrens will fall . we will have tariff free ports , total control of our vat and the most vibrant startup sector in europe . it is already happening .	est0xoj	ukpolitics

no worries . i do n't reject it . i quite like certain aspects of it like the free health care for the elderly and the 4 day work week . both of those policies i really like but i 'm not sure how they will pay for it . would the loss of revenue for businesses hinder our standing in the worldwide market ? why would a company want to come to the uk if they are paying for 5 days but only getting 4 days work i know there is a productivity boost that should mitigate that hopefully ? i do n't know the answer to these questions but labour did n't seem to know either , or they just have n't explained it yet . as i mentioned in another reply , it 's the honouring of the referendum that 's the biggest issue for me as it seems like a direct blow to democracy . i do n't want to start a leave vs remain debate but the fact is a vote was held and leave won . it should be honoured as such . i think labour mentioned in their manifesto that they would honour the result with a 2nd referendum on the deal itself but they lied about this in their earlier manifesto so i 'm not sure i believe it . they strike me as a remain only party tbh also corbyn wanting to abolish private schools after attending one himself . i can get behind policies to close loopholes surrounding private schools but closing them altogether ? in my tin foil hat mode i think he wants all children in state schools where they can push socialist rhetoric but that 's a far reach . also some comments made my mcdonnell regarding abolishing capitalism scared me a little , we are a capitalist country and it needs to remain that way . i 'd welcome some soft socialist policies to fund services like the nhs , powerwater infrastructure etc . i really do n't know who i am going to vote for but the fact that mentioning that i would just consider voting tory was met with comments calling me fucking stupid is amazing anyone that outright claims they would never vote for a party just because of who they are rather than how good their policies suit the next 4 years is an idealogue . what do you think mate ?	f6spfpx	ukpolitics

no problem , i apologise for not being clear ! are you claiming that there hasn't been a huge rise in outrage culture over the last few years ? i 'm saying there has been a rise in outrage culture and a significant pushback against it , evidenced in part by people taking no issue with voting overwhelmingly for someone who says he shudders when walking past black people and so on or , in the us , proudly voting for someone who mocked disabled people and women . if you express particular views on twitter , such as certain statements being racist , you 're just as likely to be mocked for that opinion as encouraged . i think its an issue on both sides of the debate , mainly due to a lack of mutual respect . to be clear about the other part of my comment your definition of political correctness is the avoidance of forms of expression or action that are perceived to exclude , marginalize , or insult groups of people who are socially disadvantaged or discriminated against . '' now , if you think people are expressing antiwhite , antistraight or antimale sentiments , and you want them to avoid doing so , is that not political correctness per your definition ? you want them not to do it because you perceive them to be excluding , marginalising or insulting white , straight or male people . if it 's not political correctness , why not ?	fbasrvu	ukpolitics
