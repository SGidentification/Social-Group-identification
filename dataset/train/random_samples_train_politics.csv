well , they take the freedom and refine it down into a powder , and then package it up and send it to iraq . when it gets there , they sprinkle it all over the iraqis , and since the terrorists hate freedom so much , they are irresistibly drawn to iraq to fight rather than attacking the united states . that 's why bush says we 're fighting them over there so we do n't have to fight them here .	c031aup	politics

i agree with this statement . at this point , it 's too late for a third party to have any tangible effect on the election except to spoil someone else 's victory . yes , we can make a statement by voting third party and showing the country that a growing number of americans are dissatisfied with the parties in power , but at what cost ? four years or more of john mccain is a nauseating concept that could become a nightmarish reality . a serious thirdparty candidacy must begin years before an election , and have significant commitments , both personally and financially . the barrier to entry in our system is high , but not insurmountable .	c05diwu	politics

heh , not a bad point , though the idea that there 's an ideal mathematical formula that could determine how much support a candidate deserves based on their number of supporters and cash reserves well , it strikes me as kinda funny . did giuliani get far more press coverage than he should '' have ? based on his eventual performance , sure . however , he was always going to get that coverage based on his location , press familiarity and national recognition . no more or less fair than the fact that hillary has a former president campaigning for her . i 'll also bet that paul got loads more coverage simply because he was running in the republican party , as opposed to his last libertarian run . the fact of the matter is , politics and the media 's approach to it is n't fair . if you do n't have the attention of the media , it 's probably because you do n't have the support of your party leadership . does no good to complain about it , really . it does n't mean the other candidates are puppets , either . simply that the candidate and the party tend to agree . is that so odd , people agreeing with each other ? oy , i must be in a speechifying mood . sorry .	c032e2w	politics
yeah , libertarianism is basically classical liberalism and it 's my understanding that the rest of the world still uses that definition . most liberals '' in america would be called social democrats elsewhere and since they are for a mixed economy '' , they are n't called socialists since there are real socialists in many other countries it 's easier to see the difference . it basically comes down to this we talk like fags and our shit 's all retarded .	c02vlie	politics

'' meaning.. to assassinate them ? without trial ? habeus corpus ? do n't get me wrong , i support obama though i 'm british , but this is a terrible contradiction . the biggest foreign policy mistake america made was to invade afghanistan , and then iraq . there should have been a concerted effort to round up those responsible , extradite them to the united states , or the hague , perhaps even extrajudicially , and put them on trial in a civilian court . i thought that was what would happen in the days following 911 , thinking of how israel dealt with the munich disaster.. oh how wrong i was .	c05cmxs	politics

the selection strangertolove chose habeas corpus in its most familiar form ad subjiciendum has played an important role in angloamerican history as a safeguard of individual liberty . right , so if it 's a safeguard of liberty , then liberty is something other than habeas corpus . you responded by telling him he does n't know how to understand what he 's reading , missing the whole fucking point of the concept of universal inalienable rights '' . i know it 's an abstract thought , but basically if it was created by the west it ca n't be an universal rights . universal rights are there whether we know about them or not , whether our state tries to deny them or not . a caveman in the jungle has liberty because he can do as he choses has liberty . even if he 's captured and put in a prison cell he can refuse to comply with orders , and still has some kind of liberty . if nobody creates or grants him an attorney and the right of habeas corpus then he does n't have that right . if you can be alienated from a right it is n't an inalienable right . understand ? ?	c04codc	politics

i appreciate your counter argument , and i stand with everyone else here in saying that it does n't matter what our opinions are , releasing the video is the only sensible thing to do . to your first post , i 'm not bashing you , but people having an opinion that it 's possible is not enough to convince me . i 'm just skeptical , and i think i should have the right to be when confronted with evidence that would prove this , but for some reason is being withheld . additionally , the one thing about the simulations that you posted that bothers me is that the official story about how the plane fit into a hole so small in the building is that the wings collapsed on impact , folded in against the side of the plane and were sucked in with everything else and that 's why the building was not as damaged as most had expected . when you look at the simulation , the simulation has the wings hitting the building full on and tearing up the building and supporting columns until the pieces of the wings disintegrate . the official story even seems to contradict this simulation . i 'm not saying i believe any conspiracy theories about what did or did not happen , all i 'm saying is that i reserve the right to question all of this until everything is on the table . with all of the science articles that get posted to reddit , people are applauded for raising questions about the data and authenticity of the arguments presented . when it comes to arguments about what did or did not happen on 911 people are shunned from asking questions , like we 're supposed to just accept whatever we 've been told . which i understand is mostly because of the people raising these arguments doing a poor job i have no doubt a plane ran into the pentagon , but until we 've been given all of the evidence , i do n't see why we should stop asking questions . just my 2 cents .	c046ybu	politics

first of all , cindy was just able to get one point out , and the pelosi slanted host rushed her on her question . and if you think pelosi gave a cogent argument to the question , you have been listening to different clips than i have . here are the other questions collaborator pelosi needs to answer to , if she wants to actually represent her constituents in san francisco . why do you say that you are against the occupation of iraq when you have given george bush billions of dollars of blank checks '' to wage it ? why did you vote to give bush the authorization to attack afghanistan , when afghanistan never attacked the us ? why did you vote for the freedom and orwellian named stealing usa patriot act ? what did you know about the administration 's inhumane and grisly policy of torture and when did you know it ? why did you allow it to continue ? why do you support the no child left behind act that is effectively destroying our education system and allows for the active recruitment of our young people by military recruiters ? why did you give telecoms and bushco immunity from warrantless wiretapping ? why did you destroy our 4th amendment by the fisa modernization act ? why did you give the banksters on wall street 700 billion dollars when people are starving and sleeping on our streets ? what is your plan to pump liquidity into the people 's economy to allow prosperity to gurgle up and no longer trickle up ? why did you take impeachment off the table when the bush administration have clearly committed high crimes and misdemeanors and why did you say on the view that you did n't know of any crimes bush had committed after congressman dennis kucinich charged him with 35 impeachable offenses ? what are and what will the implications be for allowing bushco to slink off unpunished ? why did you cave into the republicans and allow the ban on offshore drilling to expire ? why do employees in your companies not belong to labor unions ? why do you support free trade agreements that oppress workers and destroy the environment ? why are you claiming in campaign literature that you obtained federal funds to clean up the hunter 's point naval station to help the community of bay view , when the funds were to be used to decontaminate the area where you hope the new stadium for the 49ers will be placed ? why did your congress not work to protect our elections from fraud and tampering of voting machines that can be easily compromised ? why have n't you held a town hall meeting in the district since 2006 but you have the time to sell books and fund raise all over the country ? why wo n't you debate your congressional opponents ? what are you afraid of ?	c065zx8	politics

i agree with a lot of what you said , but the difference between iran and the specific countries you listed india , pakistan , and israel , is that those are the only nations on earth who have not ratified the npt URL . you can certainly make arguments that states selectively enforce the treaty , renig on their promises about reducing arsenals , or have core security interests which differ from their stated goals of arms reduction . but these are more subjective than a state signing a treaty which is is not compelled to do , not invoking article x 90 day withdrawal from the treaty , which a state can invoke at any time , and then proceeding to break the treaty anyway , in the face of unanimous opposition of the international community . that 's a big deal . israel , pakistan , and india knew better . the point of my comments is to illustrate that both the u.s. and iran are both very culpable for their actions . the president asserts that we 're the good guys and they 're the bad guys , and the response on reddit is that he 's got it backwards . obviously , both are fallacies . if the u.s. decides to bomb iran , it is making a very specific decision which will have serious repercussions on it 's future security . similarly , iran has had , does have , and will have numerous chances to avert such an outcome , even if bush 's goal is to bomb them whether or not they are a threat . it 's not goodguybadguy , it 's two dick 's in a pissing contest .	c035o1u	politics

smart companies would rent out the service . more administration . the logistics alone would add a layer of inefficiency . businesses compete on having resources allocated most efficiently to help out paying customers . no . businesses compete on having resources allocated most efficiently to maximize profits . that 's a big difference , and its crucial to the delivery of health care , which is most effective in itself rather than as a method of generating profit if allocated based on medical need , not based on ability to pay . now , if you complain that poor people can not get mri , then you have to realize that not everyone can get an mri because there is not enough mri hours available for everyone . why not ? in countries that regard access to comprehensive health care as a right , access is rationed based on medical need and the people who need it get it regardless of how much money they make . would an illegal immigrant qualify ? would a tourist ? would a temporary resident ? these are small groups of people . i 'll leave illegal immigrants for last , since they 're a special case . tourists do not have coverage , but a if you 're traveling to another country , it 's a good idea to take out insurance and b canadian hospitals often just swallow the cost of people who do n't have coverage , since they 're such a miniscule segment of the population . temporary residents get coverage after either three or six months i do n't remember which . as for illegal immigrants , i recognize that 's a significant problem for the us . however , it 's mostly a function of the us economy seeking very cheap labour to perform certain categories of jobs . it seems to me that either a your immigration policy should reflect this reality so immigrants do n't have to sneak in to do the jobs the american economy demands andor b your labour code should effectively prohibit companies from paying wages that are so low they can only attract illegal immigrants to do the work . it 's certainly not a compelling reason not to adopt universal health care . if immigrants work and pay tax , they 're helping support the system . in any case , the country could afford universal health care for what it 's already spending , so the point is moot . i do not see how a bureaucracy will magically go away . there 's no magic . as i already pointed out , a health clinic in a single payer system swipes the patient 's health card , records the service provided , and bills the public insurer . the insurer pays . it 's very simple , and it explains why canada has 1.3 percent administrative overhead whereas the us private health care sector has 11.7 percent administrative overhead . if , as you say , the government needs the same overhead as the private sector , why does the canadian system have ten times less bureaucracy ? why does the american public sector have only a quarter the bureaucracy as the private sector ? the only magical thinking i see here is the thinking that flatly refuses to acknowledge facts that contradict a preexisting ideology .	c031n02	politics

shit , i was thinking about starting a blog just so i could discuss this very question , and how incredibly hypocritical this is . one interesting thing i have found , is when you ask a christian the question , what happens to aborted babies ?

'' you get the response that they are most likely in hell , assuming that they were n't a christian . so , according to these people who voted for bush to save the unborn , it would be better to send 1 million or so people to hell , than to send a few million to heaven . also , say a baby , who would have lead a terrible life of sin and what have you and never become a christian , say this baby gets aborted before birth . according to the majority of christians that i have talked to , aborted babies go to heaven . therefore , would n't it be better for this baby 's soul if it were aborted and went to heaven ? rather than if it ended up in hell because of it 's life ? i 'm not necessarily saying that i think abortion is the best way of dealing with unwanted pregnancy , i 'm just saying the christian argument against it is a very , very poor one .	c03af3e	politics

history time ! this is nowhere near the first time the government has created policies which created a property boom supported by easy credit . the government spent too much money in 1812 , expanding the money supply and artificially making credit easy to get . european governments artificially induced a state where us food producers were doing very good by fighting the napoleonic wars and destroying a lot of food production capacity , which created a speculative bubble in us farming . when the bubble collapsed , a huge number of people could n't pay their debts back , causing a defaults , bank closures , and a recession . in 1837 , the government began forcing people to pay for government land with gold or silver . andrew jackson had eliminated the central bank during his presidency , with the intent of removing cheap debt from the economy . the banks responded by printing paper currency , which meant debt was artificially easy to get why was this legal ? . the restriction on buying government land drove up land prices , which led to a speculative bubble in which people took out paper debt to buy gold or silver . when the bubble collapsed , a huge number of people could n't pay their debts back , causing a defaults , bank closures , and a recession . in 1857 , the california gold rush caused a huge influx of gold into the economy . this had two effects first , a speculative bubble in railroads , and second , easy access to credit . when the bubble collapsed , a huge number of people could n't pay their debts back , causing a defaults , bank closures , and a recession . in 1873 , following the end of the civil war , a huge number of people were released from military service , and the money supply was massively increased by federal spending . this created a speculative bubble in railway industries , and provided easy access to credit . when the bubble collapsed , a huge number of people could n't pay their debts back , causing a defaults , bank closures , and a recession . in 1893 , the sherman silver purchase act remonetized silver , causing inflation which led to an easy supply of credit . unlike other recessions , this one was caused by massive protective tarrifs of the mckinley tarrif act , which instead of causing an artificial bubble , instead collapsed the value of healthy markets by forcing a heavy tax burden on manufacturers and farms who relied on imported parts . in 1907 , j. p. morgan stopped a recession from happening by providing capital during a period that saw many central banks around the world , which led to the creation of the new york federal reserve bank . european governments once again destroyed their agricultural output with the onset of world war i. further , the creation of the new york federal reserve bank made credit easily available by eliminating the risk of bank runs . the homesteader 's act was altered to allow land that could n't be irrigated to be sold . the combination of europe 's war and america 's deregulation created a massive speculative bubble , which was supported by a few unusually wet seasons . the unusually wet seasons ended causing a collapse of the speculative market , one of the worst environmental catastrophes of american history . when the bubble collapsed , a huge number of people could n't pay their debts back and suddenly had farms they could n't even farm on , causing a defaults , bank closures , and a recession . the y2k bubble was one of the few bubbles fueled by nongovernment interference . a simple mathematics issue caused every industry on the planet to spend money ensuring their businesses would continue functioning during the year 2000 , causing the incredible speculative bubble in tech . this speculative bubble was fueled by record low interest rates , leading to easy credit . when the bubble collapsed , a huge number of people could n't pay their debts back , but a new speculative bubble in housing was brewed and interest rates were brought even lower . that brings us to today . housing prices were artificially driven up by reducing legislation regulating lending standards sending lots of people into the market at once . then , interest rates were driven very low by the central bank , both of which created a climate of incredibly easy credit . when the bubble collapsed , a huge number of people could n't pay their debts back , causing a defaults , bank closures , and a recession . history shows that the government artificially induces large speculative bubbles , and government policy artificially causes inflation which fuels the bubble and makes the bubble burst a tragedy rather than a loss . since unlike most armchair economists around here , i refer to actual historical facts , you can check my facts . unlike most armchair economists around here , i 've made testable predictions that have proven true . i 'm not terribly special , but i 've got more than enough stock to be capable of saying yes , this is my view of things and it 's not just a pet peeve '' .	c0ch2nb	politics

you owe me a new keyboard ! i just spit coffee after reading your claim that reaganomics was keynesian . well done , mr. comedian . but here , i will explain why your statement is false keynesian economics is an applied theory inside of freemarket capitalism . just so you know , to be a keynesian is to support the free market , not mock it . the theory advocates stimulating the demand side of the market to spur economic growth . stimulus packages to consumers is one policy which is keynesian in nature . reaganomics was the antithesis of keynesian policy . reaganomics advocated stimulating the supply side of the market to spur economic growth . tax cuts to businesses and eroding regulation are both policies which make it easier for companies to supply goods and services . laissezfaire economics is an abstract policy , not applied like keynesian or reaganomics . yet laissezfaire capitalism advocates the lowered cost of the means of production like capital and labor . at the most basic level , laissezfaire capitalism advocates lowering costs on the supply side of the market . this is why a correlation exists between reaganomics applied theory and laissezfaire abstract theory . i hope this helps to set the record straight . but now that this fallacy is in the open , i 'm going to have a tough time buying into any of your future arguments . the seem to be full of it . since you likely feel the same way about my thoughts , let 's call this discussion to an end . until next time , happy learning ! edit yes , let 's bury our heads in the sand when we hear something we do n't like . quick ! downmod ! downmod !	c070oq9	politics

quick synopsis morality dictates that health care is a human right it 's unamerican to commodify public health . long synopsis despite the moral consensus that health care is a human right , the debate gets distorted by hospitals and insurance companies that hide behind the smokescreen of profit loses . historical precendent , however , suggests that public demand will eventually overwhelm corporate resistance it 's just a question of educating americans . other countries have lower costs because they have a single , unified system u.s. has overlapping programs that compete veteran , native americans , medicare , doe , etc . socialized systems have higher life expectancies , disproving the ageism argument we rank at the bottom for infant mortality , compared with other rich countries u.s. rations medical care now , other countries do n't and it 's unamerican to not care for others so long as you 've secured your own selfinterest .	c0clr8z	politics

it 's a great thing that a trade union is voicing a political opinion , it is my view that unions should advocate a stand of international class solidarity . however , i must ask what is actually the meaning of this ? does it help the cause of palestinian workers and does it truly shows class solidarity ? i will elaborate . for one thing , in this day and age of globalisation , a true boycott is something very hard to achieve . e.g intel has a huge factory in israel , and so many pc 's are at least to some extent an export of israel , would they stop using intel chips ? microsoft is another great example . google also . you can say that you only boycott israeli companies , but that also can not be done effectively . look at your cell phone , it has parts that were made by so many different countries . even the tomato you ate for lunch was grown using technology from dozens of countries . one can argue the boycott is symbolic , if so how is it any better than a declaration of the union against the actions of the israeli government or the occupation ? which leads me to my main point , is it helpful ? i mean apart from letting some brits feel good about themselves , is it truly helpful ? would it pressure the israeli government in any way ? not really . actually , i think it is rather counter productive . now i know my point is not the most common amongst leftists , but it 's worth a thought . true international solidarity , imo , should be made with israeli workers and palestinian workers . i mean the only powers that can really end this conflict are the israeli and palestinian masses the working class . but instead of building a class solidarity that will cross the national divisions in pursuit of their common interest , these boycott advocates are simply playing into the hands of the israeli government and ruling elite . this makes it easier for their nationalistic propaganda . instead of winning the jewish working class over , they are pushing them further away to the hands of the israeli elite which promise them 'defense ' and 'security ' .	c0dcg74	politics

in 1967 things were a little different the soviets had no compunction against arming the syrian and egyptian armies , but the united states was less than eager to keep supplying the israelis to the degree they needed to drive off the numerically superior arab forces . the israelis covertly developed nuclear weapons not as much as a deterrent against arab countries , but as a deterrent against the loss of american aid . i.e. , 'if we lose a conventional war , we will nuke our enemies . ' this reached a pitch during the yom kippur war , in which the syrians and egyptians did surprisingly well in the early portion of the war , causing a lot of israeli casualties and loss of materiel . at this point , the americans were only providing petrol and ammunition in aid , and the israelis feared that without more equipment support they would lose the war . they decided to assemble their nuclear warheads and long range missiles out in the open . naturally this was picked up by u.s. spy satellites , and in order to diffuse the threat of nuclear war in the middle east , the americans decided to start an airlift to israel . in short , israel 's superiority over its neighbors has not been a historical constant , and covertly developing nuclear weapons allowed it a bargaining chip with its patron state . once the weapons were fait accompli , the great powers had to wink at their existence .	c0dsa0f	politics

interesting that you cite the the great depression . monetarists , including milton friedman and current federal reserve system chairman ben bernanke , argue that the great depression was mainly caused by monetary contraction , the consequence of poor policymaking by the american federal reserve system and continued crisis in the banking system . and however , the federal reserve allowed some large public bank failures particularly that of the new york bank of the united states which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks , and the federal reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed . he claimed that , if the fed had provided emergency lending to these key banks , or simply bought government bonds on the open market to provide liquidity and increase the quantity of money after the key banks fell , all the rest of the banks would not have fallen after the large ones did , and the money supply would not have fallen as far and as fast as it did . the federal reserve could have prevented the depression , but it chose not to , and instead wanted to make an example out of failing banks .	c0e3hhb	politics

i use these bits of logic ... the fbi has a history of catching terrorists in the act , as we have seen this year . the planes on 911 were 13 full and if you look at the flight lists you 'll find government affilated employees and contractors , including raytheon employees that tragically died that day in those flights . the technology was available and tested in the norad drills from 9401 to 91101 the u.s. government was warned , as we all know , of an impending attack . we know that they were monitoring these hijackers for months before 911 and monitoring bin laden as well , so it is safe to assume they knew where they were on the morning of 911 . the sting op theory fits better than any other theory , because the two other theories 1. the government just messed up or 2.the government attacked itself to go to war ... each do n't make complete sense when applied to the facts . i also look at the warnings people had with text message , the warnings that the mayor of san fran had not to fly and i think it was ashcroft who was told not to fly also . intelligence agencies around the world were warning the u.s. of an attack , and lastly the first lobbyist to bypass the obama administration 's no lobbyist rule '' was from raytheon . now , speculating , you can jam a remote signal using a c130 aircraft . this is just speculation though , i can not logically say what may have went wrong with the sting op to catch these guys alive and use them as proof to fund the intelligence agencies and go to war with afghanistan or something to that affect .	c0ek9mt	politics

having heard from many people directly who said things like , i really want the union but i was terrified that they 'd fire me if they found out i voted for it , '' and other statements along those lines , i think i 'll believe what i know to be true , rather than what you deem ridiculous . think of the process this way , as described in my post above a majority of people sign a petitioncard stating that they want to be union . the company is required to honor that request be entering into immediate negotiations with the employees . at the same time , postings go up telling workers the process to generate a secret ballot election to decide whether or not they really wanted to be union . this is how efca would work under current legislation . you still get your sacred secret ballot , the only difference being the workers at least get a chance to negotiate a contract with their employer , and actually get a chance for their majority opinion to be honored before the employer drops the shithammer . having read your other posts , i doubt you 'll ever concede that this could be fair . but i think you should at least entertain the notion that the employer has a much better chance at remaining union free '' under the current system than perhaps they would if the system was truly balanced . i 'm pretty sure your day job is dependent on it , in fact .	c07dacu	politics

a little while after i turned 18 i moved down from ohio to georgia to live with a love i 'd met online . the relationship went along pretty swell . i landed a job at a steak house waiting tables . unfortunately i was terrible at it , but my personable and professional demeanor bought be another job not too long after at a chain pharmacy as a cashier . i picked up pretty quickly . i 'd used a similar register a couple jobs previous , and the only thing to do besides run the register was straiten the store , clean , and change price tags . oh , and weekly truck day when new stock came in . anyway , i 'm a sort of hobby intellectual even by yank standards , even if i did delay college . my boss is a white pickup driving , cowboy boot wearing , adulterating good old boy farmermanager . my co workers include a lazy ho who likes to brag about how her kids are n't her husbands and read celeb mags , a crazy chick who will make you look bad at any given opportunity and is stalking someone 's cousin , the cashier who 's on disability and gets whatever she wants because she 's fooling with the boss , and the manager that 's the boss 's friend , but pleasantly quiet . and the 2nd assistant manager bitch manager who gets the hours no one else wants but makes sure the bathrooms get cleaned regular . dai ' and i work the evening closing shift because no one else wants to , and neither of us care because we 're both sorta night people . actually , dai just does n't sleep much because he drinks shit tons of caffeine to help with the migraines he 's prone to . always has a 2l stashed someone nearby . we shoot the shit a lot because the store is pretty damn slow pretty much all the time , except right around valentines day and because we 're both big scififantasydnd geeks . he thinks i 'm awesome because i 've watched enemy mine 1000 times , i think he 's cool because he teaches me how to throw a good punch and staves off the terrible , terrible boredom and generally makes my job more fun than not . one day i accidentally run a red , bug and but up the front end of my car . he comes over a couple days later to hammer and stomp the hood into place so i can drive it , which is great , since i 'm a poor kid and the town is n't the sort that you want to walk around in , even during the day , even when it 's not like 100 degrees and swampy out . there 's a lot of crack heads scuttling around . one day i go over and baby sit his boys they 're so cute and well behaved so he can make another court date with his estranged wife and maybe someday the gawdaweful divorce that has dragged on forever will end . one day i end up in the hospital with some weird stomach thing that gets fixed with major surgery in for a week with lots of pain killers , and he comes to visit for a bit , bring a pot of daisies and some fruit from the garden . his mom sits with me overnight once because freaking hospitals suck at night and it 's not like i have a lot of friends who are willing to stay . a while after i get out of the hospital i move back up north because i 'm out of work and to be honest , the living conditions we had in ga were n't really great four kids in a shitty , shitty tailor , eating crappy frozen food and cereal , have maybe 4 whole friends down there after a year . i keep in touch with dai ' a bit on the phone . about 6 months later i through my exroommatecoworker that dai 's been arrested as suspect for shooting his estranged wife . he was convicted recently and i think he 's been sentenced to life in prison . his mom too . she was an accessory and tried to bribe an officer to go essentially dig up the murder weapon and plant it on someone . it 's weird .	c0fmx2x	politics

few news outlets report anything in an unbiased fashion . which is why i constantly look for opposing viewpoints , and then decide for myself what my opinion is . this can be used as an excuse for taking any source seriously . my overall point is that fox is not like cnn or nbc or anything else . fox is not news . it is political propaganda . recognize it as such . but the same could be said for cnn and acorntype liberals uh , no it ca n't . this just shows how really uninformed you are on the media and on what liberals actually believe . first , using the phrase acorntype '' liberals is extremely insulting and demonstrates a huge cognitive bias that tries to equate the noncritical thinking of the far right with that of the left . although there are noncritical thinkers on left , this problem is far more prevalent on the right . the vast majority of the left in the united states which is simply known as the political center everywhere else tends to err towards science and rational thought , while the right tends to fall back on fundamentalist beliefs in both religion and free markets regardless of evidence . this is why the right elects an incompetent buffoon such as bush while the liberals elect people like bill clinton rhodes scholar and barack obama editor of harvard law review . second , actual liberals generally do not like cnn . it has compromised itself as a news source to compete with fox . their pathetic attempts to be hip are both forced and unnecessary . their excessive focus on worthless stories such as michael jackson and balloon boy demonstrate their laziness as reporters . in general , there are many more sources that liberals like better for news e.g . pbs , npr , ny times and commentary the blogs or msnbc 's evening shows . newshour ? no , and maybe i should get on that . it actually covers the news rather than just giving sound bites . anymore i end up listening to talk radio . hopefully this is sports talk and not rush . if so , you are already lost . rush and his friends cause brain damage . as much to yell back at the crazy hosts as to think about what they 're saying . it 's too late . seriously , do not waste your time . these people are professional trolls and shills for the republican party . they use classic propaganda techniques . just put on music or sports talk . 75 of my news recently has been from reddit i think reddit is a good way to gauge what is happening on the internet , but gets way too sensationalist at times . it is still fun though . please do n't take my defense of fox as a wholehearted affirmation of them . i simply think they 're taking more than their share of shit . with the exception of shep , i think fox is n't taking nearly enough shit . as long as they put beck , o'reilly , and hannity on tv , then they should be attacked wholeheartedly . they are poisoning our political climate with this garbage . if you are n't listening to viewpoints that invite you to question your beliefs , how can you ever learn ? as i said above , being able to recognize a useful source from a nonuseful source is the most important skill here . you are n't going to learn biochemistry from a hobo just like you are n't going to get good political information from glenn beck . there are plenty of conservative sources out there that are much less ridiculous . although i do n't agree with them and think they do misrepresent the truth , krauthammer , the wsj opinion page , and the heritage foundation at least try to keep the political debate from turning into prowrestling . i may end up coming off as wishywashy about my opinions this is tough to discuss without talking about a specific issue . i think that simply based on cold hard facts that american politics has degenerated into two camps the extreme right and everyone else . i think the extreme right can be factually shown to be wrong on nearly every issue no wmds in iraq , global warming is the scientific consensus , the cra did not cause the recession , the founders did not intend the us to be a christian nation , etc. . therefore , given this environment , it makes sense for any rational person to oppose their views and their propaganda i.e . fox . this does not mean that you have to be an obama partisan or anything like that the democratic party is extremely diverse opinion wise because it is basically everyone that was antibush , it just means being able to recognize when one particular group is completely full of shit .	c0f2c1i	politics

cnn is retarded . i think i and many other rational intelligent individuals recognize much of cnn 's coverage as a waste of time . factchecking an snl clip has nothing to do with political leaning , and everything to do with not spending time on important stories . just because cnn does n't attack everything obama 's administration does , like fox does , does n't mean that they are staterun . if you say that cnn is acting like it is staterun , then was n't fox news staterun under the bush administration ? as for the great economic recovery , '' i 'm not a professional economist , but i 'm pretty sure the unemployment rate is considered a lagging indicator of economic viability , because it takes a while for companies to realize that the economy is getting better , orders are up , and it 's time to hire new employees . many would say the the recent improvement in the dow is a clear indicator of new economic growth , but i think it 's more a result of increased confidence in our economic system . i personally think that the bailout of banks and the auto industry worked , to some extent , but i think there 's a lot more that obama can do to benefit the economy . the economy is a cyclical agent , there are always ups and downs . i question the motives of people who claim that the economic downturn was obama 's fault it was n't , it started back when bush was elected , and it was one of the reasons obama was elected , the people thought that the old policies were n't working for them . was the stimulus the best possible plan ? maybe , maybe not , i 'm not sure we will ever know , but i think it did serve to slow the recession and shorten its overall duration . finally , the economy is n't on it 's deathbed .

fox version of reality fascism is big business getting in bed with government URL i can not fathom where these people were when bush had enron in to help with energy policy giving haliburton nobid contracts , and selling every piece of unspoiled land to developers . top it off with a healthy dose of do you even know what fascism means ! ? ? the people who buy these arguments are not dealing with reality . from what i 've seen firsthand , the people protesting and making the loudest noise will a not face any tax increase , and b not be the ones most affected by the eventual cost of the stimulus package . of course , they 're watching faux news , so their concept of reality is already heavily distorted . does anyone have estimates on their actual numbers ?	c08vtqq	politics

do n't know about anybody else , but i have n't forgotten bush 's argument , and i agree that some of them sound quite similar to what obama is saying now . yet i 'm tentatively supporting obama 's plans . to address the points you 've mentioned i would n't justify the current effort by pointing out that obama is doing exactly what he was campaigning on , but i would certainly argue that his current course is no reason to act surprised . anyone who has been paying attention during the campaign knew about obama 's position on afghanistan . regarding the second point i 've long been a proponent of the you broke it , you fix it '' approach to military interventions and nation building . on the other hand , i also believe that you ca n't oppose a war while supporting everything that prolongs the war . that really puts me in a pickle . i did n't exactly like bush 's surge in iraq , but it 's kind of in accordance with the first principle and i kinda have to admit that the surge , coupled with what is usually called a political effort '' including massive bribing of the leaders of warring factions seems to have done the trick , at least in iraq . chances are that the conflict between sunnis and shiites and other factions , which at times really resembled a civil war , would still be going on if american troops had simply left the country two or three years ago . of course , a lot of that could have been avoided with at least a minimum of postwar planning before the invasion , but that does n't mean that stepping up the effort in 2006 was necessarily a bad decision . had the original invasion occurred under different circumstances e.g . comparable to the kosovo intervention , i would have supported what i would have seen as a genuine peacekeeping mission a lot more enthusiastically . i 'll readily admit that my support was quite a bit more lackluster due to the fact that i thought of the entire iraq war as an idiotic , misguided , foolish , halfcooked and illplanned neoconservative misadventure that was sold to a scared population based on halftruths , deceit and outright lies . apart from that , here 's what i see as the differences between obama 's and bush 's policies i think the fundamental distinction is that obama is going into the whole thing with a set deadline or that 's at least my hope . it may well turn out that afghanistan can not be governed in the way we in the west like to think about nations and governments . without going back to the wars that were fought in the region hundreds of years ago or the more recent futile attempts of the british empire or the soviet union to install friendly governments in kabul and prop them up by sacrificing endless amounts money , material and troops , it may turn out that possibly due to the lack of a modern infrastructure no national central government will be able to exert enough influence over the entire country to keep regions from falling under the influence of local warlords , militias , extremists etc . which might eventually be able to once again take over the capital . then again , using the military to protect a serious civilian re construction effort , it might just be possible to get enough done to weaken the influence of radical groups to a degree where foreign troops can finally start leaving the country without simply handing it over to the next wave of extremists . the soviets were quite aware of the fact that that was essentially what they were doing when they decided to pull out of afghanistan . in that regard , i see a firm deadline as the crucial point things will have to get done , because after that point , the troops are leaving the country . no openended we can not give alqaeda a timeframe for how long they 'll have to wait '' nonsense . local 'insurgents ' will always be able to simply wait you out , if that 's their only goal . if anything at all , it needs to be a focused effort , and i 'm hoping that setting a deadline and sticking to it will do just that .	c0gkpux	politics

this issue has nothing to do with restrictions on a woman 's right to get an abortion . yes it does . well , strictly speaking , it restricts her ability rather than her right . if you read the article , you 'll find that the bill already prevents federal funds from covering abortions something that i do n't agree with , but that 's another issue . the proposed amendment goes one further and prevents any insurance company that receives federal funding from covering abortions at all , regardless of whose money is used on the abortion itself . since many , many insurance providers receive public funds e.g . publicprivate partnerships and companies who provide insurance to government employees , and some of those providers are the only option in their respective regions , this bill would severely restrict the availability of abortion coverage to people who paid for that coverage everywhere , and effectively abolish abortion coverage in some areas . funny how one of the only proposals that actually mandates government intrusion into people 's health care decisions came from the republicans .	c0gyltn	politics

13 ! ? ! 13 year olds simply do not have the life experience or presence of mind to understand the consequences of substance dependency such that they should be allowed to make such a decision . especially given that 13 is smack dab in the middle of a crucial learning and development period , the introduction of substances which are counterproductive to cognitive development and to the development of motor control is a horrible idea . again , i 'm not against marijuana legalization , but we certainly need to approach it rationally . as it stands , i can see but one exception , that children are exposed to substances such as alcohol in their households as their parents see fit without intrusion of the authorities unless the effects of such exposure spread outside of the home . surely , if you live in a family where marijuana is a part of the cultural fabric , maybe a youth could be exposed to it when under strict supervision and control by parental figures . most people do n't have much a problem with young teens having a glass of wine with the family at dinner , the same experience could be replicated with marijuana and be regarded as a reasonable accoutrement to culinary experiences with good reason . on the other hand , giving adolescents the ability to acquire these substances themselves with no supervision or control is horribly irresponsible . still further , it actually is n't appropriate to rely on comparisons when considering the specific policy details as psychoactive substances have radically different effects and consequences . you ca n't argue that the legal age for x should be such and such because the legal age for y is such and such , each needs to be evaluated on its own .	c0zlql3	politics

well , frank 's argument is that calling the estate tax the 'death tax ' is actually more accurate to what it is a tax on death . most voters would oppose a death tax , not realizing that the tax would have no influence on them but on people with large fortunes and estates . the problem is that most citizens are unaware that politics is largely a manipulation of language used to serve special interests . for example , it is a republican staple to say all taxes are bad while at the same time giving tax breaks and loop holes to the wealthy who would provide the most taxes and be burdened the least by taxation . then they complain about the rising deficits that they caused by getting rid of such taxes while increasing spending . people follow the gop 's talking points because it is what they like to hear without realizing that when assessed together , does not make logical sense . the message being conveyed by obama and the dems might not work , the plan might fail , and there could be facts and truths which are being manipulated or hidden from us . though what is currently being presented still holds up to reality and does not contradict itself . and reality is unpopular .	c0jswo7	politics

for me the problem is n't taxation it 's the amount of taxation and the way the taxes get distributed . most of what you 're referring to has to do with federal taxes and thus is n't very applicable to property taxes or education budgets . i do think most of what public education does in fairly useless and could be vastly improved by rethinking the entire approach , and that it could probably be much more effective at a much lower cost . maybe dramatic budget cuts will help achieve that . for instance , i think band sucked . i would 've much rather learned to play the guitar than the useless trombone .	c0jxg7w	politics

speaking as a student , i can answer only part of this . if you do n't want an example , just skip to the end . first of , grasp how extremely long it takes for evolution to happen . in maybe onehundred generations , a genepool may change in the ratio of , say , small wings to larger wings , since the larger wingedanimals have a higher chance of success in lifeURL that is a general species evolving , there is no branching off of other species . now consider there is a sort of bird that is a very bright blue . it has a lot of predators that enjoy eating it . over a very , very long time , the birds that were born either darker blue or lighter blue survive more often then the bright blue ones . this is because the light blue ones can blend in with the sky from some angles , and the dark blue ones can feed at night , when they blend it . the darker blue ones have more pigment , the lighter blue ones less . if you cross a darkblue and a lightblue , you will get some sort of brightblue bird again . even though the light blue and dark blue birds look very different , so long as they can interbreed , there will still always be some fluke brightblue birds , but these will rarely reproduce themselves as they quickly get eaten . over time , some of the darkblue birds begin to be more active at night . the activeatnight birds survive much more than the other darkblue birds . lightblue birds that are active at night do not often survive though , since their light feathers are highly visible to nighttime predators . since only darkblue birds are awake at night , they will eventually only reproduce with one another . they will not have a chance to interact with any lightblue birds , so there will no longer be a brightblue type of bird . eventually , they may develop their own courtship rituals and thus not even consider lightblue birds as potentual partners anymore . once the two types of bird can not mate under normal circumstances anymore , they are considered distinct species , and there will not be an intermediate anymore . since the speciation event takes so very long to occur , there will probably not be any brightblue common ancestor birds left . tl dr a species is defined as a group of animals that can only reproduce with their own kind . common ancestors can not reproduce with any species that branched off from it .	c10jkgd	politics

it 's stupidly inane to expect some few individuals to govern us better than ourselves . it 's mindblisteringly inane to expect politicians in particular to serve in that capacity . the reason our governments are n't purely democratic is because the owners of the country did n't want to cede their power to poor farmers and minorities . the bullshit about republicanism protecting minority rights is hogwash . how long did it take our socalled 'democratic ' republic to abolish slavery ? and then how long did it take to guarantee blacks basic civil rights ? there 's a pretty goddamn good reason that the original constitution only gave blacks 35 's of a vote and their slavemaster was the one who got to use that vote . all the rhetoric about republicanism originates from the oligarchic philosophers of ancient greece URL . there 's a pretty goddamn good reason we know the names of plato , aristotle and cicero and all of the athenian democrats have been lost beyond the pale of history . democracy is n't a cure all for social ills . bad things can happen under it . but the answer is n't to select from the population a group of supermen to rule the rest . the answer is to education the population broadly on the facts so they know not to persecute minorities because they might find themselves as the next target . it 's in their own selfinterest to offer the securities contained in the bill of rights to everyone else . we do n't need to rely on republican guardians to protect us from ourselves . we need only to rely on our own selfinterest with a dose of education to keep our heads straight . of course , given the state of education in this country , we might be better off without . but that 's a whole 'nother story .	c0mmmc2	politics

most importantly , there is no reason the government an ideal leviathan , not our current farce can not take the place of an investor . not only can government investment in the poor be shown to have some of the highest theoretically possible economic force multipliers over an entire society i think the major difference is that a company without the use of government can not force me to take part in anything , but not only can the government make me join in , i can be called a criminal for refusing to participate . i am not telling you you 're a piece of shit . i 'm telling you why you are wrong . i hope you 're open minded enough to take this posting as food for thought . fair enough . i just have no problem with capitalism and detest any form of communism . edit also , a lot of the things you mention except military are localstate funded systems . why is everyone so gung ho on raising federal taxes on people that very well might be paying through the roof in county and state taxes ?	c0zgksv	politics

there are a lot of really dumb videos of these tea party folks saying incredibly stupid things . the grass roots elements of the tea party are no longer in control of the movement it has been coopted by money from groups like the koch brothers and americans for prosperity . if they are more than a footnote in history books books in texas excluded , they will have created a new and better origin story than than the one based in reality . most likely the tea party groups will be coerced into supporting the next few wacky right wing ideas and then they will be left to fade away before they gain any real power . but yes , if anyone 40 years from now watches any of this nonsense they will look a lot like some of the civil rights stuff from the 1960 's . keep in mind though lots of folks got killed in the civil rights movement . the tea party , so far , is just a bunch of idiots being dicks .	c0mpv90	politics

depressions recessions are just variously sized ponzi schemes collapsing . you 're referring to the boombust cycle . that has nothing to do with ponzi schemes . ponzi schemes pay current investors their dividends out of the buyin payment from new investors . boombust has been going on for centuries , and is a matter of consumer confidence building too far , overvaluing commodities . thus 911 and the housing bubble , the cycle continues . 911 and the housing bubble have nothing in common . one is just another aspect of the boombust cycle , and the other is a terrorist attack . false positive economic indicators since then . and your evidence for this accusation is ... ? quite the opposite , you 'd shut down what little mfg . is left . military contractors are n't a significant portion of the economy . most economists could find their ass with both hands . i think you mean could n't '' . i 'm not surprised by your sentiment , however antiintellectualism is the trendy thing for religious fundamentalists to resort to when their uninformed opinions are contradicted by people who actually study the subject matter for a living . please predict . let 's see ... if the tea party is anything to judge by being the political arm of the religious right , these people are going to continue to undereducate their children , demonize intellectuals and atheists , have kneejerk reactions that blame the problems of the country on others instead of realizing that every situation is nuanced , and go to church at least once a week . further , these same people will go further and further in to debt because they do n't know enough to understand how credit and debt works . they will continue to vote as their religious demagogues tell them to . they will continue to lead unhealthy lifestyles that lead them to all sorts of health problems , but they will oppose any sort of health care system because they 're been fooled by fox news and the religious right that such a plan would bankrupt the nation never mind that we 're spending more , as a nation , paying for er visits by people who could n't afford preventative medicine . i could go on , but you can boil it down to gullible masses listening to single sources of information and believing them without question , and by so doing acting against their best interests while feeling self righteous about it . to what ? wake up to the fact that there is no god , every holy book on the planet is just the work of bigoted men from hundreds of years ago , and we 'd be better off following the golden rule than some ridiculous sets of rules set up by goat herding savages who did n't understand the basics of science . there is nothing divine in the bible , the torah , or the koran they are the works of men , and nothing more . if they were divinely inspired , they would n't be riddled with so many errors , and would n't be actively contradicted by every field of science . edit i wish that people would wake up to the fact that prayer does n't work if it did , we would n't have hundreds of years of study to the contrary . i wish people would wake up to the fact that a literal interpretation of the bible is contrary to objective reality . i wish people would stop ignoring objective reality for what they want to be true , because wish and pray all you might , it wo n't change the way the world is . i wish people would stop looking to a book written by savages as a source of morality , because that same book has tacit approval of rape , murder , slavery and genocide . i wish people would stop making disingenuous arguments about religion being responsible for morality in the world if that were the case , the most atheistic countries in the world would be the most violent and dangerous , but they are n't they are , in fact , among the safest . i wish people would wake up to the fact that religion is just a tool used to control people , and that control reinforces itself by being taught to children at such a young age that they ca n't distinguish fantasy from reality that is the only way religion perpetuates itself in the modern age . in short , religion is less than useless it actively harms humanity , and we 'd be better off without it .	c11coeo	politics

you just went and listed out the part that says the qur'an says beating is ok , now you say no one is saying that is ok , let alone islam . it does say that because it is an ignorant book . no you listed a part of the quran and then mistranslated it to fit your skewed interpretations and opinions of islam which , if i may add , are based on the actions of a few . how many muslims do you know ? how many happy muslim marriages have you witnessed ? how many unhappy ones ? using the actions of a few as the basis for your judgments is the definition of ignorance , but hey if it makes you feel good then right on . as for slavery so you 're happy to figuratively imply '' lots from scattered words which somehow excuses the direct references to slaver , but when i point out some very clearly ignorant parts of the qu'ran that do n't rely on any figurative inference magic there 's a different set of rules and islam does n't actually say what it says ? yes clear and direct and you found a way to mis translate and skew them . congrats . as for being arrogant , condescending it 's hard not to be arrogant and condescending to people trying to excuse domestic violence and asking silly questions like what are the situations where slavery is allowed '' . your arrogance is in the fact that you dont even consider anything i say and immediately insult it and brush it off rather than trying to think about the points i am making . but hey , arguments are won by the loudest right ? as for what i was saying on slavery islamically freeing a slave is one of the best deeds a man can do , from the verse i quoted . do you think that slavery does not exhist today ? that is the question i was trying to get you to think about . slavery has never disappeared from this planet , it only changed forms is what i am trying to say . oh yes , i 'm sure all those 12 year olds married off to dirty old men going off mohammed 's example i might add are happy with their lot in life because you say so . sure all the women unable to leave the house without permission are grateful they do n't have the choicesfreedom to make up their own mind . i 'm sure the girls banned from an education are so much happier that some bearded men choose to enforce islamic misogyny on them . wow . all those 12 year olds ? i am sorry but your going to have to start using sources when you make these claims . as i previously mentioned , my knowledge comes from actually walking around those streets that you imagine are filled with bearded mean and sticks hunting women down . my knowledge comes from living and befriending those people who you seem to think are filled with households of uneducated women . what facts are you building those ideas upon ? islam is an ideology that these people happily live by . those that are n't happy with it do n't live by it , but most are happy with it . the unhappy and unpleasant cases you are basing your opinions are , are obviously much smaller than the normal cases you ignore . and please , quit saying i support domestic violence . you do n't know me and if you did you would know that i am far , far from supporting domestic violence . the prophet 's pbuh last address to the muslims before he died was an address completely geared towards ensuring the protection of women , their rights , and ensuring that they are taking care of treated well . he compared them to delicate , fragile vases . good muslims know this and will thus never physically harm a women .	c10nxqn	politics

i disagree . while some of them may indeed be racist as evidenced by their idiotic signs , i think it cheapens your argument to try and paint all of them as such . i think a much larger factor is the fact that some of the policies obama is putting into place seem to fly in the face of their particular ideology . just because their ideas do n't make sense , does n't automatically mean that they hate black people . maher made very good points , up until the end where he resorted to some tactless namecalling . although i 'll concede them being sore losers .	c0os2gb	politics

the whole collection argument is flawed . keep in mind this whole discussion is assuming they adopt the post fire payment option . many businesses flourish with this kind of payment scheme . the worst case is that they sell the debt to a collection agency . delinquent accounts are just another expense that adds to the costs . most businesses that sells something account for this except for those that only accept cashprepayment street vendors , lawyers , scammy tow companies , etc . essentially , everyone serviceable by the fire department becomes a customer . those that do n't pay are considered overdue accounts . if one of these accounts needs the services , they would get them but be liable for back payments plus any additional fees they want as additional compensation or the whole cost . i really doubt it would be hard to make this profitableneutral with proper collection practices . even if they could n't , the cost of the actual response is very minimal compared to the cost of being able to respond which the department has to pay anyway . additionally , even if they refused to service people who did n't pay , they have to respond anyway in most cases to prevent the fire from spreading to paying customers .	c11lnh7	politics

thanks for the post . this is a good point . i get that you do n't want powerful dems coopting and manipulating the movement . but i 'll take issue with one sentence in your post , '' they 're trying to make it about class warfare , when it has nothing to do with it . with all due respect , amid all the coverage and posts and blogs and photos , one thing is clear , if you ask 5 different protesters what their movement is about , you will get 8 different answers . and to disagree with you , class warfare '' is one of them . in fact , some of the signs and at least one of the most popular facebook profiles to arise out of the movement meets that issue head on with the name i acknowledge class warfare exists . URL one of the features of ows certainly is that the movement lacks a clear message and a simple statement of cause . whether that is ultimately a problem or an advantage remains to be seen . but therein lies the problem with your own attempts to define it . you seem to be projecting your own idea of what it is onto a much more amorphous and hardtopindown group .	c2rrs2r	politics

well , one of mine in pays up to 25 in atm fees , you each get 25 when you refer someone , but the main one is this they do n't try to fuck you out of every last penny and tack on a ridiculous fee for everything . both banks and cus hold your money for you , but the bank will try to hold it and never give it back . it 's usually easy to get an overdraft fee removed at my cus too . both of mine have a auto transfer from savings service too , so if you do overdraft it will transfer 100 from savings for a fee of 1 , so you do n't overdraft even once , let alone multiple times . when i tried to do this at a bank , they said i had to open a line of credit to do this . and all this really is is just moving numbers to other numbers . automatically . cus do n't charge you to walk up to a real teller like some banks do . some cus also have a program called balance '' that 's free and you get free credit advice . this program is awesome . it 's worth joining a cu just for this program especially if you have credit issues . those reasons are usually enough to convince people to join they just do n't always actually do it . edit formatting	c1k1w1x	politics

i walked into a bank in 2007 at 27 years old . single and with a decent job they told me i qualified for a 200k house . i settled for a little less and even so have had to deal with a lot that the bank did n't tell me about . my original loanescrow payment was based on the old appraisal value meaning at the end of the first year i owed the city a couple more thousand texas . also , i 'm still paying pmi on this thing which has increased to almost 200mo . that was like 40mo before the bottom fell out of the market and people started defaulting sending mortgage payments through the roof . i guess that 's not the banks fault but it was not explained to me . and think about all those people who they talked into an arm loan . they offered one to me too but i took the fixed rate . allinall i 'm still a lucky one . i live in a city which has n't seen a huge dip in prices and i 'm still right side up . i 've also increased my income since then and have n't been jobless through 3 career changes . the only debt i have now is the house . the fact is that i was misled on what i can afford by the bank . i thought they were on my side and they were n't . some shady shit went down when i first purchased the home . the banker i was working with ended up selling the loan to another company then buying it back . i 'm def . not an expert but i 'm not dumb . i expected my bank to be on my team and it seems they were just serving their own best interests .	c1vvfmg	politics

if you think school should be free that 's a whole different discussion . high school ? yes . college ? just cheaper . college tuition has gone up much greater than the rate of inflation despite the fact that the value of having that degree has started to actually decrease . we 're headed for what i can only describe as a college bubble bursting and it 's going to be very , very bad . we need state and community schools better funded so private schools have more competition . high school migh be free but food and shelter are n't . you said i agree on 6 years of college , but he has to finish high school for 2 more years to get into college . can you elaborate on what you 're trying to say here , because i think i misunderstood . you are assuming jerry 's salary is growing for the whole 20 years , it 's actually only the 12 after he graduates . oh , you 're including his time in school in the 20 years . that explains your arithmetic , too . yeah , that 's also stacking the deck . jerry 's going to work until 65 , making a very healthy salary over most of that time . jeffry will make almost nothing for that same amount of time . you ca n't just ignore that by making half of the time you 've randomly chosen as the time jerry is in school . you are confusing taking risks with luck . people choose how much risk to take , like investing in an expensive education . no , i 'm totally clear on what luck is . luck plays a big part in where we end up . luck like rich parents or being in a good school district or being born with a particular talent could be the difference between jerry and jeffry . you ca n't just discount that when factoring success . my point is that progressive taxation of salaries is a poor way to try to redistribute wealth . we do n't just tax salaries to redistribute wealth . the inheritance tax and cap gains taxes are also good for redistributing wealth so as to avoid extreme inequality .	c33hugu	politics

congress is bought out by lobbyists , i know . but what happens when regulation is left to the state government ? you think the same exact thing wo n't happen ? the issue is n't that the federal government has too much power , because in today 's environment i think that it 's necessary that they have the power to regulate the problem is that corruption and payouts are rampant , and that 's the issue that needs to be dealt with . if the federal government was n't so easily bought out , and were actually incentivized to regulate these massive financial institutions , we 'd be in a better spot . but to say that the federal government should shrink , and relinquish the majority of it 's power to the individual states is n't going to fix anything . edit see this comment by yodatuna URL . it seems to sum up my sentiment . as far as the economy , sure if we 'd listened to ron paul we would n't be in this mess . but there were thousands of people who predicted this mess . ron paul was n't the lone , shining star trying to prevent it . the economic disaster we 're in has nothing to do with ron paul . it has to do with the fact that banks were able to invest read bet on absurd financial instruments and securities that were massively leveraged , because there was no regulation in place to prevent them from doing so . it 's because that corporations , if allowed , will do anything to make more money , and honestly , that 's what they 're supposed to do . but there should have been more regulation in place to prevent them from gambling with money that they did n't have , and then pushing the debt on to the american people . i do n't know who to vote for . no one looks like a good candidate . which is pathetic . i do n't know why you 're assuming i 'd vote for obama , because like everyone else , i feel that he was a massive disappointment . no one looks appealing to me to be the figurehead of the american government , and giving any of these men the massive amount of power that they 'd inherit scares me .	c39nxee	politics

not something that was so important it required sinking an allies ' ship and then praying that the us would cover it up for 40 years . well , from what the people who heard the tapes said , the israeli ground controller who ordered the attack seemed to want them to sink the ship . if that had happened , it would have made covering up the whole thing quite a bit easier . regardless of the why , the fact that this event never underwent a congressional investigation with so many us intelligence agency members and sailors claiming that there is absolutely no way they were mistaken for egyptians seems ... odd , to me . it was rather neatly swept under the rug in short order for such a messy problem . my general feeling on the matter and , of course , this is just me is that the golan heights thing could very well be the real reason . we are talking about a nation that bombed the hell out of several population centers full of innocents because some dickweeds fired some shitty dumb rockets at israel . i feel like their actions are very spiteful and vengeful , on the whole . but that 's just a personal opinion , so i 'm not offering it as an argument to sway anyone .	c1dm4hi	politics

how is that youtube thing relevant ? i need context ? the black panther party started from sentiment like this and mlk thought it was a bad thing to do , precisely because he thought that a war with white people engaged in the things that they were good at . they had the power , and they had the institutions , and challenging it on that level was going to be like asking michael jordan if he wanted to play a game of horse and expecting to win . the point of nonviolent protest is that it challenges power to have restraint . and in the process it causes power to use tools that are ineffective in such a case , because it is readily seen as brutalizing , and overreaching . this is why , precisely , it can be effective . like , if you punished your kids by beating them with a belt , and had you do it in public , it would be immediately clear who was using their power in excess . revolutions are scary and they often as much harm as they do good while the system is being changed . edmund burke had such observations of the french revolution . and that informed early america .	c2zzief	politics

what ? no one is free to place debt on anyone i do n't know what you 're saying . if the government wants to place debt on itself or others in order to pay for things , then that 's their choice , not mine . i guess math and economics is n't your strong area . here 's the way it works . you go driving , no seat belt , no health insurance , and end up seriously injured . you get a life flight helicopter ride from the accident scene to a hospital , get several operations , spend a few weeks in a coma , and then sadly die . your hospital bill is let 's say 850,000 . but , your not insured , and your dead , so the hospital ca n't collect the money from anyone . who is going to be stuck paying the 850,000 ? everyone in your community who gets sick and goes to that hospital or other hospitals in their network . that 's why an ibuprofen tablet costs 23 in an er , because of all the bills that never get paid . because you felt seat belts infringed on your freedom , and you did n't wear one , your injuries were worse costing more money , which everyone else is stuck paying . and , because you felt having to have health insurance infringed on your freedom , everyone else is stuck paying your hospital bills through increased prices when they seek care , and increased prices everywhere . the ripple effect continues . when insurance companies see that they have to pay hospitals more for all the unpaid bills , they raise their rates . that costs businesses more money , increases their overhead , and that cost gets passed along to everyone who buys goods and services , even if they never get sick . that 's not libertarianism . that 's sticking the rest of the us with your bills , and paying for you .	c1h2quf	politics

what a load of shit . the foundation of conservatism is a belief in individual freedom and personal responsibility .

no you want to look at the cost of a particular good now and then , and compare it to the wage now and then . inflation refers to the general increase in prices . it 's not uniformly distributed . so compare the cost of a dozen eggs then and now , or a lb of potatoes then and now , etc . overall you will see that with the exception of housing and cars , most everything else is cheaper per hour of labor today than before , and cars are much higher quality today . well , i ca n't really see anything because you 're just asserting stuff without providing any evidence for your claims . and i 'm curious as to where you think the numbers i linked to come from then ? how else do you think they measure how much 1968 dollars are in 2012 dollars ? they do exactly what you suggest doing , i.e . compare the cost of various goods and services that households buy ... 1 sure thing well , i was more interested in trying to figure out what your take on income distribution URL is . no matter , i have it here myself . yes , it 's true that people who actually make exactly minimum wage or lower make up a small portion of wage earners . however , you can see that the minimum wage 8hr i estimated back up in the previous comment would come out to 16kyr or so . but if you look at personal incomes , you 'll see that the number of people who make 25kyr or 1.5x the minimum wage , or lower , end up with being 48 of the total population , or about 115 million people . the current system , where nearly half of the american population makes up to 1.5x minimum wage , is supposed to be good or desirable ? of course it 's not , because we look at how easy people can have some kind of drastic lifestyle change such as illnessinjury , and they 'll be left to rot because they ca n't save up enough money to be able to afford things such as being out of a job thus missing payments such as rent , food , utilities , etc . and health care . this current system is simply not efficient if your goal is to maximize happiness . if you want to maximize something else i can totally understand , but i 'd prefer making people happy . that 's kind of the point . the minimum wage increases unemployment , but not everywhere pretty much only among low skilled workers whose productivity is at the margins of the minimum wage . 2 it does n't always happen , but 3 there is a clear trend res ignored duplicate image you linked to the same thing twice , did you mean to do that ? in any case , i think i 'd dispute both the idea that minimum wage increases unemployment , as well as the idea that reduced unemployment ought to be the goal in the first place . looking at this URL , i think that the benefits currently outweigh the drawbacks . but as i said before , i 'd prefer basic income over minimum wage . oh i 'm not ignoring that , but the point is that increasing prices or decreasing benefits both still hurt the worker . right , which is why if the workers were in charge democratically , those things would n't happen . this argument you 're using is simply an argument for a more democratic system , so that workers can decide to decrease the net income , rather than to increase prices or decrease benefits . i think you may be operating under the assumption that these companies have huge profit margins to begin with . uh , they do . corporate profits are at an alltime high . this idea that they 're just barely getting by is nonsense . and even if they were , it does n't effect the owners one lick , because they are already rich . it 's only if they start getting serious losses , i.e . no net profits at all , that they may decide to simply retire and ditch the company , resulting in a sort of collapse of the pyramid from the top to the bottom . you 're just looking at total profit . that says nothing about the profit margins per sale and the productivity of the employee , which also varies by job description . well , i do n't see you providing those numbers to share , so why bring them up as supporting your argument when you do n't even provide them ? even so , individual productivity really does n't matter at this macro scale i only care about how much surplus was made total , not exactly how much surplus came from each individual worker . because the total productivity of that employee still must exceed their wage , or they 're a loss . i 'm sorry , but that 's what i 've been saying this whole time . i 'm not sure how this fits into your argument . the productivity has increased , but their wages have not . income inequality is not relevant . singapore has virtually no poverty , less than 2 unemployment , and high ranking healthcare and education . please stop being averse to providing citations for these sorts of claims . it 's just wasting our time because i ca n't really respond to this until i can verify it myself . i think you misunderstand . it costs money to have a safer work environment . the firms are not required to provide them , and the workers can choose to work for them with higher wages as a trade off or work in safer firms for lower wages . they choose how much they will work . and i think here is the fundamental disconnect i disagree that singaporean workers can freely choose how much they will work , considering the fact that they are limited by things such as needing food , water , and shelter . saying that they can freely choose how much they will work , is like saying that saudi women can freely choose how much they will cover up . sure , they can choose not to work , but then they 'll starve or become homeless , much like a saudi woman would be beaten if she decided to not cover up as much . if you 're okay with letting people become starving or homeless , then you might not care , but i 'm pretty sure the people who actually are stuck in that dreadful situation care quite a bit . voluntary . the major point is that wages will not be super low in the absence of a minimum wage law . only if there are significant regulations regarding the flow of labor , such as antiimmigration policies . if you keep the demand for labor artificially high as it is in many western nations that limit immigration , then yes , you can have higher wages . in any case , you 're missing the larger context of how labor unions in europe are much more powerful than they are in the united states . without labor unions of the same strength in the united states , we will end up with minimum wage racing to the bottom URL . so you see numerous examples where wages are sufficiently high without a minimum wage law and you still hold onto it ? maybe you do n't seem to understand , but my point is that simply increasing or decreasing the minimum wage is n't enough . there are other factors that need to change along with that change in the minimum wage . you ca n't just abolish the minimum wage without also introducing basic income , otherwise a great deal of workers not just minimum wage workers , but nearminimum wage workers will see their wages slowly plummet to the global price of labor . i think that the current minimum wage in the united states needs to be increased , but my ultimate goal would be to introduce basic income and then abolish the minimum wage . it must be in that order . basic income would mean people who are n't working still get a minimum income , which would disincentivize working . have you ever lived on minimum wage ? there is a huge , huge incentive to want to increase your wages and have a much better quality of life . and that 's the whole point . and even if there are a few people that want to sit around and do nothing their whole lives ... i 'd rather they do that than starve to death or resort to things such as committing crimes . placating people with basic income is a great way to reduce turmoil . plus , what would it be ? it could n't be too low , so what 30,000 a year ? even limit that to people of working age 200 million that would cost ... 6 trillion dollars . that 's assuming that the current prices on goods and services would stay the same after this massive restructuring of the economy . it 's not . in addition , yes , it would cost a lot . but it would also bring a lot of gains as well . and the gains would far surpass the costs . it would be worth it .	c8xn9e5	politics

maryland , delaware , and illinois all rank as above average when it comes to gun violence when you crunch the numbers through their fuckedup filter . this study is such bullshit . it 's basically designed to discount gang violence as insignificant by doing things like focusing on categories like women killed by guns '' as if a woman being killed by a gun is so much more tragic than a man being killed that those deaths need to be doublecounted . if you take gun homicides and only count them as being 10 of the gun problem , you get really fucked up results '' . . . no shit . 3 police officers were killed by guns in alaska in the past decade . these three deaths are given the same weight in this study as the 15,000 people murdered by guns in california over the past decade . also , the study does n't compare apples to apples . if you 're going to focus on police officers murdered , you should look at officers murdered per 100,000 officers . . . not officers murdered per capita , otherwise all you 're doing is pointing out who has the most officers per capita . if you 're going to look at gun suicides as its own category , you should look at gun suicides per 100,000 suicides , not just per capita , otherwise all you 're proving is that places with a high suicide rate have a high suicide rate . wyoming , vermont , and south dakota , three states with the weakest '' gun laws , had such low homicide rates that they were statistically discarded by the cdc . because these data were discarded for being too low , the study does n't use them to factor into the scores of these states . i mean if there were ever a study that made you repeatedly facepalm , it 's this one .	c9892dg	politics

first off i would like to say that it has been nice to have a real conversation that actually is based on facts rather then one that devolves into slinging insults . right , that 's the point me and a lot of others around the country are trying to make . those looking for a body count are going to get what they need regardless of the laws . in order to prevent all gun violence there would have to be a 100 ban on weapons , eliminate all leaks in the borders , and become essentially a 100 police state . as long as there are firearms , there will be gun violence . what it would take to prevent it , i do n't want . i do n't think anyone thinks that banning assault rifles is going to end gun violence , and if they do then they are simply delusional . that being said it is something that when added to other changes to both firearms regulation as well as mental health care will have a strong impact . no criminal laws no matter what they pertain to are going to stop said crime from ever happening , but that does n't mean that we should simply not enact any laws . the goal of any gun laws have to about making more difficult for criminalsnutcases to get the weapons in the first place and allowing for better overall firearm tracking . i agree , but different firearms are going to be more or less dangerous based on more than a number of reasons . a .50 desert eagle is going to be a lot more dangerous than a lady 's s w . a .3006 is going to be more dangerous than a .22 target rifle . all can be deadly , but at that point we 're arguing semantics based on design . i am definitely arguing this aspect , all firearms have the potential to be dangerous . that being said i think that one has to look at the design and purpose of said weapons when debating gun control . i simply look at magazinesemi automatic based rifles and see only one real purpose to them , putting rounds out rapidly . again i did n't just come to this conclusion based on what the press and such have been saying , i actually shot them . i wanted to understand if there was anything to the issues people have with the or not . like i said they scare me somewhat , not cause they are the bogeyman '' of guns but cause of their potential for violence overall . banning assault weapons wo n't stop that . it would take a 100 ban on all firearms on top of extreme police state actions to stop things like that . again nothing is going to stop people from wanting to hurt people . what the goal of all this limiting it , just all other criminal laws . the answer to this is not a one and done thing , but rather involves multiple aspects , and even then nothing is going to stop gun violence . example , oklahoma city bombing ... he did n't use a firearm . the church nut who blew up an abortion clinic ... he did n't use a firearm . people will always find ways to hurtkill others if that is their goal . i understand that completely , but we need to make it as difficult as possible for them to achieve this . explosives are ridiculously regulated , and it works since people are not blowing other people up everyday . he fault is n't with the firearms , it 's the fault in the people and regardless of the regulations and laws and bans they will always find a way , that 's why they are criminals , and that 's why i do n't want my right to own a firearm to be taken away . i do n't want the government to say i ca n't have a gun , and the government is n't pushing that agenda . i simply think we as americans need to take a step back look at what this nation has become . the homicide rate is one of the highest among industrialized nations , and much of this is due to firearms . it is not all about spree killers , but rather about the big picture of violence in the united states . the thing about sandy hook and the like is they serve as the catalyst of change , which in this case has pushed assault weapons to the forefront of the argument . i 'd rather have one easily available and not ever need it , than need it and not have it . see what i 'm saying ? i completely understand , and agree even . the thing is why does it have to be a ar type rifle ? a shotgun is generally a better choice for home protection in general . yes your military service makes you more comfortable with an ar , but in general a pump action shotgun is better choice overall . as for hunting again there are other options for people to use so again why does it have to be an ar or similar type rifle ?	c7wykyr	politics

more accurately federal prosecutors argued that they have to meet the lower standards of the stored communications act rather than the probable cause standard of the fourth amendment to collect cell location data from a telecom , since that data just like phone records has been voluntarily shared with a third party and collected as a business record . the fifth circuit court of appeals agreed with them URL the cell service provider collects and stores historical cell site data for its own business purposes , perhaps to monitor or optimize service on its network or to accurately bill its customers for the segments of its network that they use . the government does not require service providers to record this information or store it . the providers control what they record and how long these records are retained . the government has neither required n or persuaded providers to keep historical cell site records . jones , 132 s. ct. at 961 alito , j. , concurring in the judgment . in the case of such historical cell site information , the government merely comes in after the fact and asks a provider to turn over records the provider has already created . the contact s telephone number is necessary for the service provider to connect the call the user is aware of this fact therefore , he is aware that he is conveying that information to the service provider and voluntarily does so when he makes the call . a similar analysis for cell site information leads to the conclusion that a user voluntarily conveys such information when he places a call , even though he does not directly inform his service provider of the location of the nearest cell phone tower . because a cell phone user makes a choice to get a phone , to select a particular service provider , and to make a call , and because he knows that the call conveys cell site information , the provider retains this information , and the provider will turn it over to the police if they have a court order , he voluntarily conveys his cell site data each time he makes a call . we understand that cell phone users may reasonably want their location information to remain private , just as they may want their trash , placed curbside in opaque bags , greenwood , 486 u.s. at 4041 , or the view of their property from 400 feet above the ground , florida v. riley , 488 u.s. 445 , 451 1989 , to remain so . but the recourse for these desires is in the market or the political process in demanding that service providers do away with such records or anonymize them or in lobbying elected representatives to enact statutory protections . the fourth amendment , safeguarded by the courts , protects only reasonable expectations of privacy .	cdv4bci	politics

i 'd like to see a debate on the purpose of the second amendment , the purpose is explicitly stated in the amendment . it is based on keeping the state free and secure . what 'well regulated ' means well that already happened in dc v. heller , in which scotus determined that militia status was a nonfactor . the 2nd amendment does n't guarantee the right to keep and bear arms . it guarantees that the natural right to keep in bear arms already in place for all citizens will not be infringed on by the government . the militia '' thing is completely irrelevant , they were simply framing why they were n't going to infringe on the right . it did n't make it necessary to be in a militia . read it again '' a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . '' see ? they frame why they are n't going to infringe on the right , and then gaurantee that they wo n't infringe on the right . so please , explain to me how the regulated militia '' argument is valid whatsoever ? also , militia '' under usc means ablebodied citizens and prospective citizens aged 1745 anyway , so it 's not contingent on being part of the ang or something the constitution , and its attached bill of rights , is a living document that can be changed with the times . and there is a specific process for changing it amending the constitution , and until that happens , the 2nd stands as is .	c7v8zkn	politics

disclaimer i wrote this as if i was responding to someone directly and then reposted it in a separate comment . you '' should be regarded as if i 'm talking about some people '' in general , if you get what i meant . this is in depth , long , and many people will either a disagree or b not understand what i 'm talking about . please try and understand the points i 'm making before blindly disagreeing . if you disagree with something or have a question , ask . do n't vote on comments based on opinion . if we could go back in time to columbine , i would wager they would have called that terrorism , the way we 're calling this an act of terror . the other difference is bombing '' . generally , bombing random people is done for attention . i will elaborate in a moment . also , the fact that two individuals were involved means it 's far less likely that both suffered from sever mental illusions like the vtech shootings . mcveigh for example is a much closer example , and mcveigh is largely regarded as the or one of the worst domestic terrorists of all time , and that was pre 911 . the classification of terrorism is generally especially pre 911 very vague and hard to pin down . it 's not even clear under the federal terrorist statutes that it qualifies as an act of terrorism . '' abunimah wrote a superb analysis of whether the bombing fits the us government 's definition of terrorism '' when someone goes around a school shooting others , and then taking their own life , they generally are n't trying to send a messages at least , not in the same context that someone utilizing high explosives is trying to send . regardless of a jihadist link being made or asserted if not proven , this type of public bombing lots of witnesses with particularly sinister 'shrapnel ' was meant to do one thing . get attention . sandyhook ? he did n't want attention , and if he did , he did n't care what happened after suicide . aurora ? same thing . tuscon ? same thing . columbine ... that 's difficult . they went for fear , and if they 'd survived they 'd probably have been treated as terrorists in the modern sense , simply because they planned to bomb the school and kill everyone , and send a message ... even a psychotic one . but it 's tough to say . the resemblance between this bombing and other shootings are n't as big as you think . the differences however , are striking . motive does n't generally correlate in , at least not these days ... but it was obvious the motive was there . get attention . we do n't know why they wanted the attention however . under the law URL these guys or this guy was n't simply trying to kill people , even if that was a goal . there are many many many ways to kill people . we 've seen it in the examples you listed , all of which had a much higher kill rate , but yet these two chose specifically to use explosives . and it worked ! they shut an entire city down . terrorism is about fear . they i would argue , must have realized that shooting a school , as much attention as it would garner , would n't send the same message that explosives did . i wish i could be more specific on this , but i 'm at work and ca n't really afford to ping around a ton of links but beyond that issue , even those assuming the guilt of the tsarnaev brothers seem to have no basis at all for claiming that this was an act of terrorism '' in a way that would meaningfully distinguish it from aurora , i completely disagree with this notion . i think there is one factor they 're overlooking . cameras if they simply wanted to kill people , guns would have been far more effective . they killed 3 in the bombing attacks . that 's not effective if your goal is to kill . i 'm not condoning it . but this proves the point terrorism '' does not have any real meaning other than a muslim who commits violence against america and its allies '' , so as soon as a muslim commits violence , there is an automatic decree that it is terrorism '' even though no such assumption arises from similar acts committed by nonmuslims this paragraph is offensive to law enforcement , media , and our justice system holistically . it 's literally fucking bullshit . total bullshit . many many many many muslims are arrested every day in the united states for violent crimes , including drug dealing , violent shootings , and beating their wives ... but you know what ? they 're not called terrorists . neither are african americans , jews , hippies , college drop outs , occupy folks etc etc etc . to say that being a muslim is the requisite for terrorism is totally disregarding the circumstances behind these bombings ... it 's seriously an absurdly sentiment . it sounds like whoever wrote this is simply butthurt . the new york times today reports that united states officials said they were increasingly certain that the two suspects had acted on their own , but were looking for any hints that someone had trained or inspired them . '' it also reports that the fbi is broadening its global investigation in search of a motive . '' there 's no reason for the fbi to search for a motive . they should just go talk to andrew sullivan . he already found it . wow . another totally retarded statement . they 're widening their search out of due diligence . these were n't american born citizens , they were naturalized . that does n't mean they 're automatically foreign terrorists , but the links between the possible terrorist groups is too high to ignore . could be they were just nuts . could be it was n't even jihadist ... but one thing remains certain . the brother did travel abroad into a terrorist haven for extended periods of time . somewhere along the line , one or both must have received some type of military training . they 're not going to investigate a foreign link between tuscon or aurora or sandyhook because some delusional asshats go around shooting people beacuse of their own psychosys . let 's talk again about mcveigh . fun fact . the fbi looked for both foreign but mostly domestic pre911 terrorist links to bigger groups during their investigation . let 's again bring up columbine . the fbi logically is n't going to look into al'queda links etc if two high school out casts kill their own class mates . it 's tragic sure , but it does n't have global jihadist movement or possible link between , i do n't know yet , no one publicly does written all over it in big bold letters . tl dr my personal opinion this is what i study in college , i 've taken a whole ton of classes and studied it from 2008 currently is that it boils down to this . three things . location read on to the airport hypothesis time because of how many people were there and how many news covering the event , method bomb is automatically terrorism in some contexts . if they had simply shot people with automatic rifles and then killed themselves , i 'd wager it would have still been called terrorism , based on the publicity surrounding it . terrorists want to send a message . violence is their means and catalyst . . update some of the top comments here are saying it 's simply because it was a bomb . this is only partly true . the fact is , if these two used high caliber , fully automatic weapons in , say , an airport , there is almost no chance it would n't have been labeled terrorism . if these two attacked a congress building , the pentagon , basically anywhere in washington d.c all with simple handguns , or even knives , this would have been labeled as terrorism . although the bomb pushes it almost by nature wmd , the way it 's defined in law not common speech into 'terrorism ' the deciding factor really boils down to what they set out to accomplish and how . some student shooting up a school or a movie theater is very different than two grown adults with no affiliation to a running event or any of the examples i 've listed showing up with a highly coordinated attack planned out , regardless of a weapon . this is why i presume they might have at least thought about charging eric dylan with terrorism way back in columbine , had it happened to today and they 'd not been cowardly bitches .	c9kng6n	politics

exactly strayhorn got 800k votes , to kinky 's 550k . and you 're right about kinky 's draw . i voted for obama three times in 2008 legally ! , and voted for kinky in 2006. i ca n't find anything that i really disagree with him on politically URL . more than that , he pretty much epitomizes the texas i thought i was moving to loud and obnoxious , but goodhearted and fun ... do your own thing , and if someone else is doing their thing and you do n't like it , do your thing louder , do n't try to get them arrested for doing their thing . since the governor in texas is supposed to be closer to a ceremonial monarch than an executive with real power , i think this makes him perfect for the job . rick perry , by contrast , is the suburban guy who thinks that because he wears boots and drives a pickup , he 's a cowboy , and who sits in his house worrying about what the neighbors are up to , and if their landscaping violates any hoa rules . while i 've yet to meet a single texan who admits to liking perry , he unfortunately represents a large swath of texas pretty well .	c876d0q	politics

here 's how this particular bit works . a company 's product does n't work as advertised and you get ripped off . you file a lawsuit against them for fraud and for unfair consumer practices . the company will file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit . that motion will say hey , here 's the contract we had with this customer . this contract says that all claims under this contract shall be submitted to binding arbitration . '' under federal law and in the majority of states that contract clause is enforcible . the court will dismiss the lawsuit and direct you to pursue your claims in arbitration . there are very limited circumstances where this type of contract might be thrown out . the contract will usually have more fine print saying something like an arbitrator wil be chosen from a list provided from the american arbitration association , and the losing party shall be responsible for the costs of arbitration . '' an arbitrator will be chosen , you have the right to object to the choice , but then they 'll pick another one etc . the arbitrartor will issue a schedule , hear evidence , and then make a decision , that decision is binding . it 's less formal than court and it usually happens much faster . sometimes rules of evidence are looser . one important part of this process is that arbitrations are almost always confidential . you ca n't tell the media or the public what has happened . maybe you win at arbitration , maybe you do n't . that would have been the case anyway . people like to say arbitrators are biased toward the corporation . as a lawyer i never thought that was truly the case . however , there is one important difference . an arbitrator is like a judge and jury combined . he will usually display what we call judicial temperment . '' meaning he is calm and dispassionate and makes his decisions according to the law . an arbitrary might have harsh words for the defendant this policy is blatant fraud against the petitioner '' however , under the law he 's limited to awarding the 30 which was the value of that fraud . plaintiffs in cases with aggravating facts do n't want calm and dispassionate juries . they want angry juries , because angry juries punish defendants and award lots of money . in the infamous hot coffee case , stella liebeck had 250,000 some in medical bills , but the jury got angry because they saw evidence mcdonalds had known its coffee was hot enough to cause serious burns , but ignored that for business reasons , so they awarded punitive damages in the amount of 3 days of cofeee sales for mcdonalds . it is very unlikely an arbitrator would ever make an emotional decision like that . here 's the big deal . suppose you got ripped off 30 in arbitration . you might well win , and get your 30 . however , in courts , there might have been the possibility of pursuing a class action lawsuit where 20,000 people sue for their 30 at the same time , but by forcing everyone to go to arbitration , they 've effectively forced each individual person to try to get their 30 individually .	ci866t3	politics

the article was mainly about millineals . you are right about the other two groups , but the different groups present different problems . the women are already gone to a large extent . they already tend to vote somewhat more democratic winning them back wo n't be easy . also , women are a relatively stable portion of the population they are n't growing . minorites are growing rapidly . however , the current tactic of gerrymandering and defacto poll taxes are reducing their impact on elections . also , i think the hispanic part of the population could be brought back fairly easily if the republicans can shut up the rightwing pundits on the topic of immigration and allow the party to adopt a more moderate immigration stance . the youth vote is a whole different set of problems . except for college towns they are not easy to gerrymander into irrelevance . they are also more likely to be able to get around the tactics of restricting voter eligibility . finally , that goup of unchurched millineals are starting to move out and start their own families , and they will be raising their children unchurched . i used to be a lay minister , and one of the dirty little secrets of growing a church is that it is extremely difficult to grow a church by converting nonchristians the easiest way to grow a church is to steal members from other congregations . that method wo n't really help the republicans very much when it comes to attracting the religious right .	clkt8pn	politics

the idea is that they do n't currently have a law where recreational marijuana is legal . that means they are limited to the rules of medical marijuana . the law for medical marijuana is that a person can have up to 6 full plants for their personal consumption . some people have been allowed under local rules to combine these into a coop to grow their weed together for personal consumption . the problem comes from the fact that they are not controlling how many plants they grow in relation to how many members of the coop they have . they are just growing massive amounts of marijuana , and it is no longer for personal consumption . the idea behind the laws was to allow people to grow together to be economical , not to turn it into a business . the feds main problem is when the operation becomes to big , it is too likely that it will 1 . enter into interstate commerce , and thus they wills top it 2 . is being used illegally even under the state law , and is being sold on the side . there should be no way one coop could utilize 4000 full grown plants .	cftsfc8	politics

hardly . that would be idiotic . you do n't build a pipeline to texas refineries to ship oil to china when you could build a pipeline to vancouver and then ship it to china . which is essentially one of our fallback plans the other is to pipe the oil east to the atlantic coast , past all of our main population centres and our own refineries , and then ship the excess to europe . are you seriously denying the reality that the oil is going to china ? URL his view , according to people close to harper who knew his thinking but aren t authorized to speak , was that sensible americans would understand the folly of allowing canada s massive oil sands reserves , estimated at 168 billion recoverable barrels , to be sucked up by china , a rising economic and political rival . you play clueless , not understanding why the first choice is for canada to ship the oil straight to the terminals that will fill up ships and be sold to other countries ? of course it 's oil going to america ... because you say so ! URL the keystone xl is designed to promote exports of canadian tar sands oil and its refined products to nonu.s. markets , especially china and latin america . china is now the largest foreign investor in canada s tar sands , representing 52 percent of all foreign investment since 2003 . why on earth would anyone build an extra several thousand km of pipeline to a refinery , to then turn around and ship the oil all the way through the panama canal ? that would be stupid . canadians know enough about geography to know that 's a terrible idea . because the fight to build the pipeline westward will be even harder than getting america to build it for you going south i 'm certainly not in favour of albertan tar sands oil and i 'm not in favour of keystone xl or any pipeline that does anything with that oil . but the economic reality is just that reality . if it will pay off to extract it and pipe it somewhere someone will find a way to extract and pipe it there . if the us does n't want the oil and it 's still cost competitive we 'll try and build a pipeline elsewhere . fortunately the saudi 's are making sure it 's not cost competitive , and at the very least by the time it is we might have a competent government in charge . and you just reworded your threatening we 're gon na ship it somewhere , it would be a shame if you did n't get a cut of it ... '' why even bother ? you spend so much energy defending it , no amount of i 'm not in favor of it '' lies are going to deflect from the reality that you are posting in support of it , and using blatant lies like it is not designed to be shipped and sold to china .	cmw9vcq	politics

you can spin it any way you want but the fact is that leaving when the us did was unwise . the agreement to leave was a political one and now it is easier to blame iraq than to say the us messed up on the start and end of the mess have you ever been a military member on foreign soil ? there was no agreement to leave . iraq wanted us personnel to be subject to iraq laws if they stayed . i 'm sorry , but you can not execute in a hostile environment under those conditions . it would have been irresponsible for us to leave troops there under those conditions . i could care less about haliburton 's contractors as they chose to be there and could choose to leave on their own it 's nice to be able to spin all these tales about us responsibility and high ideals from the comfort of a computer chair , but these are real men and women who are in our military service and who would be subjected to the laws and possibly the political whims of an unstable iraq government . you also conveniently overlook the cold hard fact that it costs money and we are n't even able to take care of our existing casualties . the only way we should do anything over there is if the us politicians first raise the tax rates to cover this war and the debt ceiling . no more running wars off the books then crying when the deficit that those politicians approved is bumping up against the debt ceiling and holding our country hostage while they do their public pssing match for their donor base . they need to live by their own mantra ... that is live within their budget ... that means , if they do n't have to money to go to war or even to the movies ... and they 're not willing to raise it ... then we should just sit home .	ciavdxx	politics

which , in large part , is where they become naive idealists rather than realists . tell me , who is more free , a man who can go sit at any table in any restaurant or a black man who can not ? they are both free in that they control their own property and bodies . freedom is not a measure of how much you can get away with but how much others force you to do things against your will . your freedom only extends so far as your personal property and public areas . no one can force you off the sidewalk or to hand over your wallet but they can tell you that they wo n't allow you on their property because of your race . whose freedom trumps whose ? the business owner 's ? the black man 's ? why ? and do n't say that the desire to make money would dissuade it , because that 's simply not true . hell , at one time , the exact opposite was true , as ignoring segregation laws was not only illegal , but a good way to become a pariah in your community . i do n't care about the racists pretending not to be to make money . it could certainly happen . and that person is an ahole but he has the right to do with his property as he pleases and you have the right to not go there . but if you start telling people they have to allow anyone into their property , then there is n end to it . what if a couple klansmen walk into a black owned store in their costumes ? or some nazis walk into a jewish store saluting ? should these people be forced to do business or can they refuse service and tell them to stop trespassing ? your argument is emotional , not logical . you want to make everyone play nice , which by the way , you will never achieve through forcing people to behave how you think is nice . but property rights an selfownership are integral to protection of all human rights . just because it means people get to be mean to one another does n't mean they are restricting their rights . cute concept , but fails in reality . what is freedom ? i 'd say a man in a european country with socialized healthcare has more freedom than i do in america . he 's not as dependent on his employer to provide affordable coverage . i 'd say a scandinavian man with having subsidized access to education beyond high school is more free than i am , who has been forced to go deep into debt to earn a degree , which in turn makes me more beholden to my employer . you being dependent on someone does not mean you are n't free . your freedom allowed you to make choices that put you in a position of needing someone to maintain the lifestyle you want . you made the choices . freedom is not the ability to do anything you want whenever you want with no cost or consequences . if that is what you think it is , you need to grow up a lot . see , this is where the libertarian ideal starts to look less like freedom and more like more probusiness , antilabor economic policy wrapped up in a freedom flag . how do you defend your businesses rights over those of the people ? how do you justify the lack of freedom your preferred ideal of freedom entails ? there 's always a nice , oh this is n't really a free market '' excuse , but no reality in the why it would work . it is n't pro or anti anything other than pro freedom . my business has all the rights i have , just as yours has all the rights you have because they are our properties . just like you ca n't walk into my home and start telling me how to live my life , you ca n't tell me how to run my business . this is of course with the caveat that i am not hurting you , nor you me . if i am dumping mercury into your water , then there is no need for a regulation that says no mercury dumping '' because doing that is an act of aggression against you , and is violating your rights . the biggest problem is the fundamental flaw in the concept that somehow john 's general store would magically be able to compete with walmart or matt 's sporting goods with dick 's . no one said everyone can compete . just that anyone is free to try . people will act in a way that is most beneficial to them . if enough people think walmart is bad and they support the small store , then they are free to do that . but if there are't enough people to support them , obviously they are n't satisfying a need so why should they stay in business ? why should they get special help from regulations and tax breaks to keep them afloat when they are doing something the vast majority has deemed useless ? absolute freedom is a nice concept , but it absolutely is n't possible with libertarian ideals . it would simply remove a sometimes tool and sometimes roadblock from businesses , and allow those with more money to continue to consolidate power . the only way people gain more money is through other people giving away their money in return for things they want . if someone provides something that everyone wants , they get their money in return . and once they have this money , how do they use it to take away your rights ? are you forced to sell yourself and your property to them ? they have a big pile of cash but if no one wants to deal with them , they ca n't do anything with that cash . the only way they get to hurt you with their money is if they get the government to pass laws by buying politicians , which would n't be possible because the scope of government would be so limited , they would't be able to pass laws that hurt anyone .	cgaajd6	politics

in addition to being wrong , you are misguided because you 're looking at the issue through the lens of resource mercantilism . firstly , you 're wrong . the refined products are going to be shipped wherever people are willing to pay for them , quite possibly to customers within the u.s. , considering that the u.s. is one of the largest percapita consumers of oil . do you really think that a refinery is going to refuse to sell to a customer in the u.s. who wants to buy their product ? do you really think that a wealthy people with a high percapita income such as americans are going to be hurting because they have to bid against foreign consumers it 's almost always the scary chinese for gasoline ? secondly , you should look into mercantilism and why it is no longer a prevailing theory . if people in other countries truly have such a need for refined products that they are willing to pay so much more i.e . the u.s. price plus the cost to ship overseas , then the u.s. either needs to 1 be more productive , or 2 get out of the way , stop using as much oil , and benefit by trading with other countries who have a better use for it .	cnq1s7p	politics
although pork barrel spending add ons are typical for immediate disaster relief funding , i find it unacceptable . there is a very big difference between adding pork barrel spending to a bill that is not an emergency , vs using this tactic when emergency relief funds are required . if republicans tacked on tax breaks to the relief fund bill , would n't democrats vote against it ? would n't that be downright disgusting ? but that 's basically what happened here .	crnosi2	politics

no . first of all , iirc that picture is from 20082009 when all this net neutrality stuff first came up on reddit . that 29.95 price would be closer to 5060 bucks now . more importantly , older people like my folks have no idea what internet is . if you told them they could get facebook for 30 dollars a month , they 'd be all over that . then they 'd scream and holler for the term of their contract as they slowly realized that their bandwidth was capped and they could n't watch cat videos on youtube or watch their shows on netflix and hbo , or shop on amazon , etc . they would n't know it , but it would be a radical change from what they 've grown accustomed to . also , i 'm not sure that net neutrality rulesthe recent fcc ruling would actually prevent an isp from offering something like this . the problem with the picture is n't that it 's something nobody would want . the picture was meant to be an illustration of what the internet could become that could be the only thing that was available . that 's the danger that isp 's could turn the internet into cable tv .	cp096yi	politics

nobody serious is making the argument that there has been no global warming , what we are saying is that it 's not a significant problem worthy of being alarmed over , humans are n't primarily to blame , and even if we were there 's not much we could do about it . peter gleick is a person of highly questionable ethics and a clear environmentalistleft wing bias and agenda URL . that being said , he affirms exactly what ted cruz said there has been no significant global warming since 1998. despite gleick 's attempt to manipulate his readers by changing the argument he argues on the predication that skeptics are saying there has been no global warming at all in the last century , which is not the case not to be confused with the idea that humans are responsible for said warming , he also used a misleading graph for the 1997 present temperatures . if you look closely , you will see that the overall warming during the period has been only about 0.1 degrees c , and is currently on a downward trajectory , meaning in a few years we could very well have literally no global warming since 1997 at all . still , 0.1 degrees is hardly cause for alarm . polar bears are n't going extinct URL , florida 's not underwater , and none of the other alarmist models have come true either . in fact , 95 of climate models were wrong can you guess in which direction , almost exclusively ? URL . so the truth is that the earth is n't currently warming in any significant way . scientists still have absolutely no way of accounting for the thousands of independent factors that contribute to the earth 's temperature , and are certainly in no position to make doomsday predictions that we should then go tearing down modern society to accommodate . and regardless , increased centralized government regulation and trillions of dollars in new taxes stolen from us by political overlords is not going to somehow solve this nonexistent crisis .	cpsprt1	politics

sure , you go tell all the countries that have been getting a free or cheap ride at america 's expense that we wo n't be helping them as much anymore and that the rest of nato needs to pick up the slack . do n't come crying to me when international relations tank . everyone loves to bitch about the us being the police of the world '' but no one seems to mind reaping benefits with low or no cost to themselvestheir country . i 'd love for all of that to change , but i do n't see it likely . nor do i think that allowing certain other countries to become dominant powers would be good for the rest of the world . the us might do shitty military things , but they are far from as shitty as other countries would and on a small scale , are . real reform will require lots of politics , negotiations , etc and ca n't realistically be done from the budget alone . that does n't mean there is n't room for trimming but to imagine that we could just cut it down to 25 of current size in one swoop is a pipe dream ,	cu31wan	politics

i believe the debt for murder is determined by a judge during the sentencing stage after a trial . in effect , if the officer did commit some form of unjustifiable homicide , that officer should pay a dept to society by doing time in prison and presumably paying fines . additionally , if that were the case , then sure , it seems the state should also be culpable for some sort of damages . do you suppose the da was the person who stuck this bargain ? is this sort of thing legally binding ? if i were to kill someone , and then i were to offer 5 million to the family for their agreement not to pursue some piece of potentially damning evidence , does that mean i get off scottfree ?	cqlrl8m	politics

all rules governing society were made up , by people . many of the rules regarding taxation were made up by the wealthy to benefit themselves . as taxpayers , we pay all the time for business owners to go out to dinner . business dinners are tax writeoffs . you pay for their lobster and steak and insanelypriced scotch . as a society , we apparently have no problem with that . they are rich . they earned the right to write off a business dinner . then people turn around and complain because they do n't want to provide poor people with food stamps . since they are poor , they deserve nothing . work harder , poor people . this example happens constantly in all different sectors . wealthy people pay a stupidly small amount of taxes on second homes . they were able to advocate for that from legislators due to their influence . it 's their money ! let 's let them keep those extra millions of dollars . they earned it . what 's ridiculous is that this rule only applies to multimillion dollar houses . my parents owned a second house as a rental property and had to pay way more in taxes on that house . and again people fight tooth and nail about giving the poor subsidized housing . the wealthy get government handouts in their own ways , through tax breaks and tax writeoffs that only apply to them . this is n't just the way it is . '' the system was made by the rich to benefit the rich . the answer is n't just work harder . '' i worked so much harder when i made less money . lowpaying jobs require so much from you physically . some people do n't have the ability to go to school or learn a skill . i 'll bet most people like to stay in hotels , eat at restaurants , shop in stores ... who do you think works in all those places ? poor people . none of those jobs pay well . the poor in our society work really hard , and everyone else relies on them , so let 's stop shitting on them like they did something wrong . why are we okay with letting someone write off sixfigure amounts in business dinners , but then throw a fit about letting others have enough money to get macaroni and cheese ? no one works ten thousand times harder than i do , but people make ten thousand times more than i do in a year .	cw7axpc	politics

i 'm not so worried about this election , if bernie had never run i would 've been perfectly happy voting for hillary . i 'm worried about the next election , about the next candidate that wants to run without a super pac and without taking donations from goldman sachs or citi or private prison companies . about the next candidate that thinks that the us should at least match other industrialized countries in health care and family leave and worker protections . i 'm worried that hillary will be fine , but that sanders losing will just prove to everyone that the pundits were right all along . that only the candidate with the big money backers has a chance of winning , and that you have to keep in mind what the wealthiest 1 want at all times , and if you go against that you do n't stand a chance . and you do n't stand a chance because most people do n't vote in most elections . so appealing to what most people want is a terrible strategy . that 's what sanders is doing , running a campaign based on what most people want , and it 's only going to work if most people vote . i do n't think we 've had a primary election in my lifetime where turnout has come close to 50 , we 're usually lucky to get 30 . even if bernie does n't win , if we can get a respectable turnout for the primaries , i 'll be happy because bernie has already shown that it 's possible to raise money without a super pac and it 's possible to run a competitive campaign relying on volunteers . but if people do n't actually vote next year , none of it is going to matter .	cwiqcuo	politics

in northern california , every doctors office i 've been in has a sign at the front desk flatly stating we will not accept any aca plan '' . that 's a violation of their allcontracts clause '' . if you accept one anthem plan , you accept all anthem plans . and so on . covered ca is a middleman or broker , not an insurer if you buy an anthem plan through covered ca , it 's still an anthem plan . so in essence , these doctors are both breaking their contracts and turning patients away because they do n't like the idea that people who do n't get insurance through work or a spouse can buy insurance elsewhere . what a class act . as for network adequacy in northern california , a local legal aid firm could help you report that to the agencies that oversee health insurance plans and enforce minimum standards . e.g. , the agencies might order the plan to specially contract with a provider to see you . those standards are set by the knoxkeene act in california . depending on where you are , the legal aid firm might be bay area legal aid , legal services of northern california , or california rural legal assistance . you can call any one of them and tell them your county if they do n't cover that county , they 'll transfer you to the firm that does . it 's legal aid , so of course it 's pro bono . usually , legal aid firms can only help people with very low income , but they make exceptions for health cases . they 'll actually be quite happy to help their mission is to improve health care access , especially for lowincome people , but the way the system works they need to do that one client at a time , using individual cases to trigger systemic change e.g . hey anthem , mr. smith ca n't find a specialist because they 're doing this whole 'no obamacare ' thing make them stop doing that so mr. smith can get a specialist , and so that all these other people can , too . '' there are lawyers who choose to work for a tiny , tiny fraction of private sector wages at firms funded by grants and donations because they want to make things better . one of their biggest problems is that nobody knows they exist , perhaps because the image of the moneyhungry lawyer '' is so prevalent in our society that people just ca n't imagine someone who would become a lawyer for idealistic reasons . i 'm happy to do what i can to spread the word . if the system is going to change , it 's going to change because of people standing up and asserting their rights .	cphoouy	politics

abortion , as defined as the intentional termination of a pregnancy with the intent to cause the death of the fetus , is always immoral . rape a terrible situation , which has the potential not only to create an unintended pregnancy for the mother , but also to inflict lifelong emotional damage on the victim . it is wrong , yet so is infanticide . incest since this is always separate from rape , i assume it means consensual sex . in which case , the two participated in an act whose purpose is procreative . the result is exactly what should have been expected . where the life of the mother is in danger this is where the definition at the top comes in handy . despite what some people try to claim , there is no circumstance where simply killing the child miraculously leads to the salvation of the mother . however , there are some things which can be done that can actually save the mother 's life , but whose unfortunate consequence is the endangerment of the life of the child . sure , you probably feel like this is nitpicking but this is a vitally important distinction to make . all actions must be geared to the preservation of life at all times .	cq8yslt	politics

stop fucking bringing the republicans into this we both agree they are a virus for the working class . then stop buying the republican story about nafta and look at history which is that clinton brought millions of jobs to the rust belt . and it stayed that way for years . nafta did n't steal the jobs away . floundering republicans did . and everyone of them has tried to build a false narrative . trade is bad '' is just the latest edition of republican misleads . in 1981 they sold us trickle down and tax cuts and cut higher ed . it did n't work . they were rescued by tip o'neill in 1988 they sold us war causes growth . '' it did n't work . we had a jobless recovery . george h. w. bush fixed it by raising taxes and making a stimulus possible . in 1993 we had continual sustained growth until 2000. the rust belt was the belt of economic plenty . ford was huge '' to use a bernie and trump phrase . we reinvested in higher ed too . but in 1996 republicans once again fed in a false narrative . to save america they promised a contract . '' that contract resulted in bush and in guess what tax cuts for the rich , trickle down , no stimulus . in 2000 they sold us trickle down and tax cuts again and cuts to higher education again ! and it failed . 6 million middle class jobs were lost . they did n't all go to mexico . they went to asia . they went to eastern europe . the economy floundered from 2001 to nearly 2004. and then , in 2006 it died . the symptoms were housing boom and then failure . but the housing boom did n't help . because we had lost all those manufacturing jobs to malaysia and china and korea . i mean jobs that built hardware and furniture and things that homeowners buy all those went to asia . today if you want to buy an adirondack chair it comes from malaysia . not from the adironadacks . so we got rid of bush but not before the end of the world happened for millions of americans . we were losing jobs at the rate of nearly a million a month . not 800k to mexico because of nafta . a million a month ! see how dwarfed all that 'trade deal ' stuff becomes when we look at history ? since 2010 however the recovery has been blocked . by republicans who never met a domestic spending bill they liked . so there were cuts instead of stimulus . and though somehow we have come through that republicans in 2008 proposed tax cuts for the rich no spending on infrastructure and cuts to higher education . and in 2010 tax cuts for the rich and cuts to higher ed . and in 2012 the same thing . and in 2014 the same . and now ... tax cuts for the rich cuts to higher education no spending on infrastructure ! and to stop trade we 'll build a wall ! we ca n't buy every little peccadillo that republicans sell and ever get america back , get jobs back , get higher ed back , get our infrastructure back . pretending that 'trade is bad ' in 2016 is just as wrong as pretending 'war causes expansion ' in 1991. they 're both phony . what we 'll get from trump is tax cuts for the rich . maybe another war for the rich too if trump is able to completely bambozzle the country like w did . .	da5s222	politics

this is where i think an important distinction comes in , so i thank you for bringing it up . sane nazis complied with genocide because they were being ordered to by an authority that would endanger their own lives as well as their families if they were to disobey . that is entirely different from claiming someone inspired you to do something that was never remotely implied by the individual . if you commit horrific acts of violence to protect yourself and your family from immediate danger , one would be hard pressed to call you insane . whereas if you do so because you as an individual interpreted someones message that way when it clearly was n't the intention , it 's much easier to make that case . people do n't blame the beatles for the charles manson murders , despite the fact that manson cited helter skelter , a song by the beatles , as inspiration for inciting a race war . rational people blame manson for his insane interpretation . i do think there is some truth to your claim , as evidenced by cases like the stanford prison experiment , where sane '' people get carried away when placed in an environment that allows for dehumanization . that said , i think the situation regarding trump is far more similar to the former analogy rather then the latter .	d7utpxr	politics

the most general effect described by dk is the tendency for the uninformed to inaccurately assess their own level of competence on a given issue . this is a very intuitive result that would have been widely predicted before any studies were conducted . the same lack of knowledge in a particular subject matter ought to both causes a person to perform poorly , and robs them of the ability to know how poorly . the interesting result from the dk studies was the statistical trend for poor performers to overrate rather than underrate their own performance . looking at your post history , it is clear that you underrate your own grammatical proficiency . this can be explained by the fact that dk describes a trend , meaning that while most uninformed people will overrate , some may still underrate themselves . it could also be explained by the possibility that you are not as grammatically incompetent as you believe . you would need to participate in a test , and be ranked in a random sample of peers , to know for sure .	d88c4ov	politics

some are asserting that because he was not found guilty , '' it 's okay . but , this was a civil and not a criminal matter . the judgement in a civil trial is either for the plaintiff '' or for the defendant .

i think gay pedophiles are gay not straight . thankfully a load of studies were done on this in the 1980s , where they found the overwhelming majority something like 97 of men that sexually abused boys were actually heterosexual or sometimes asexual when you look at their sexual attraction to adults . pedophilia is an entirely seperate sexuality where the gender of the victim has far less influence than it does in adult sexual attraction . this is why about 13rd of victims are male , yet only a few percent of the population are gay . it 's not because gay people are more likely to abuse kids .	d8an2br	politics

not really , he does n't say much in the way of policy . what he does say is inane , inconsistent , devoid of meaningful facts or details , and generally internally contradictory . so no . you do n't have one . before i delve into this wall of text , i can guarantee it 'll have very little substance and just things that you heard and never have proven . it 'll also have a lot of accusations of racism , and things of that nature . so let 's get into it , i guess . kick out 11 million undocumented workers ? the price for that is orders of magnitude higher and socially disruptive than any number of reasonable solutions to the problem . even though it 's been done throughout history multiple times . he talks about bombing the shit out of isis and how he 's going to defeat them huge so fast it 'll make your head spin folks yet is adamant about eschewing any state building . hillary talks about continuing the drone program and is adamant that , despite the fact that it 's never worked , despite the fact that it 's only caused instability , we should decide how their government is to be run , not them . without changing fundamental facts on the ground , you do n't defeat groups like isis . which is why continuing the program of death from above without actually sending people in is n't going to work . he says that our allies do n't trust us , yet he is pulling back from nato and generally shrinking the us security umbrella so much that it just might include hawaii and alaska . as far as i know , he 's never said that they do n't trust us , just that they do n't respect us and that they 're not doing what they agreed to do in nato . he said that he feels like we should either change nato so that it better reflects the problems of today , or pull out and create something that reflects the problems of today . also , i do n't see what 's wrong with not interfering in other countries like we have in the past . i love how when bush was doing it , you guys were adamantly against it , but now that hillary wants to do it it 's the right thing to do . a heavily rearmed japan which ... i think is what trump wants ? it 's hard to know for sure but some of what he says seems to be in favor of that would be one of the biggest destabilizing forces in the world . so you 're in favor of an empire , yeah ? no , he said that if japan does n't start paying for us protecting them , we should just leave , and they can do what they 're going to do . i doubt they 're going to just attack people wantonly , unless you believe that the japanese are too incompetent to handle their own country and they 're naturally violent . his autarkic economic policies are basically the worst ideas since smoothawley or the nixon price controls . that 's not an argument , specifically what ? he seems not to actually realize that we already put antidumping duties on foreign companies that have been proven to be dumping in the us as is consistent with the wto and wco . the problem is that we have economic policies that make companies not want to invest into the country , and make them instead move away . that 's a problem . it only hurts the lower classes , because those jobs are the best way for someone with no money to get a good living , because eventually you 'll learn certain skills , and you 'll be able to get a better job . he wants to ban all muslims from entering the us , then was like we can call them territories '' which i do n't really get . like ban all travel from certain countries to the us ? no , here 's the deal , what he 's saying is that if someone from an unstable majoritymuslim country wants to come into the us , we should have screening protocols , especially for refugees . if we think that european countries have an issue with muslims , we should ban all travel from those countries as well , right ? or just the darkskinned people ? we do n't think that they have issues with muslims , unless you think that the sharp rise in terrorism is okay , and there we go with the he 's a racist '' thing . he 's offering a lot of really broad and insanely disruptive ideas with absolutely nothing in terms of specificity . the more disruptive and revisionist your ideas are , the more details people want . okay , he 's been pretty detailed if you go onto his website and look at the policies , and watch his speeches on foreign policy and the economy , which are very good speeches and are very good at explaining what he wants to do . like , are we really going to say fuck article 5 if you have n't quite reached your nato guideline spending goals yet '' ? ? that 's a majorly disruptive fundamental change in american geostrategic doctrine . yes , treaties are treaties , if you agree to do something in order to get something , you do n't get that something unless you do that something . oh well , throwing uncertainty into the international security scene usually leads to fun times and prosperity for everyone . so we should pick someone who is n't god at all , but we 're certain she wo n't be good , so it 'll be okay because while the world economy wo n't crash , the lower class will be on the leash of the government , the middle east will remain completely destroyed and filled with terrorism , and the refugee crisis will continue ?

did one single person here even read the sensationalist clickbait blog post before coming in to circlejerk ? the blogger himself says that this is only assuming that there are no other changes in the country except the reduction of tax revenues from the tax cuts that donald proposes . but the very own sources he gets this number from explain that the reduction in tax revenue would be offset in stimulus of various investment modes and results in 29 percent larger capital stock 11 percent higher gdp over the long term 6.5 percent higher wages 5.3 million more fulltime equivalent jobs . the plan would cut taxes and lead to higher aftertax incomes for taxpayers at all levels of income . URL the article never says that the national debt would be increased by 10 trillion , it simply says government tax revenues would decrease by 10 trillion . the blog post is misrepresenting the numbers and assuming there will be no cuts to government spending at all , and that trump will continue obama 's spending habits , which is false .	d1o4jjx	politics

'' maybe if we did n't discuss racism it would just go away . '' tends to be a comment that i see brought up in threads like this . do you think racism can go away if people keep bringing up someone 's race every chance they get ? they ca n't defend racism without losing independents , and they ca n't denounce racism without losing their base , so it 's much better to just pretend racism does n't exist . or even better , make the very discussion of racism a bad thing . is there a double standard at play ? when 95 of black people in america vote for obama , it 's called identity politics . when 53 of white women in america vote for trump it 's called racism . racism is discrimination based on race . there 's a false belief that racism requires power and prejudice , as if hispanics can not be racist against africanamericans in america . there 's this false belief that nonwhites can not be racist . voting for a candidate based on their race is racist , would n't you agree ? poll twothirds of trump backers think obama is muslim it does n't help when obama has muslim relatives and spent time in indonesia which is overwhelmingly muslim and when hillary 's campaign in 2008 released photos of obama in muslim clothing . trump is the first modern republican to win the nomination based on racial prejudice that 's quite a big claim . so when diamond and silk support trump , that 's what ? when david a. clarke jr. supports trump , that 's what ? exclusive trump supporters more likely to view blacks negatively reutersipsos poll jon stewart said the same country that voted for obama twice is the same country that voted for trump . if you want to talk about racial disparities in crime statistics , we could . and whether you think that 's due to race or poverty . or how single mothers are more likely to live in poverty . and how black women in america are the least likely to be married . how do trump supporters see black people ? less evolved , our survey shows . does that include trump supporters like diamond and silk and david a. clarke jr. ? '' identity politics '' means discussing things like sexism , racism , and xenophobia , it means fighting for those who identify as lgbtq , or who face disproportionate discrimination . no . identity politics means you should vote for candidate x because they have superficial trait y '' , as in you should vote for hillary clinton because she 's a woman '' , or you should vote for this candidate because there are n't many muslims in congress . '' identity politics looks past character or qualifications and focuses on appearances , group identity . identity politics is n't a real thing , it 's a slang term the rightwing created to try to shame liberals into not talking about issues of inequality . identity politics is a real thing . wikipedia URL identity politics , also called identitarian politics , 1 refers to political positions based on the interests and perspectives of social groups with which people identify . identity politics includes the ways in which people 's politics may be shaped by aspects of their identity through loosely correlated social organizations . examples include social organizations based on race , gender identity , ethnicity , nationality , sexual orientation , disability , religion , culture , language and dialect . identity politics is basically a matter of ingroup URL preference , where someone 's identity as a member '' of a group based on often superficial traits is valued more than anything else about that person ie , character . identity politics values more what people look like than what they say . identity politics values appearances over actions unless you get into culture , customs , etc . identity politics is rooted in prejudice , putting your tribe '' first , and yet somehow it 's not a dirty word . identity politics is the complete inversion of what martin luther king jr said about judging someone based on the content of their character and not the color of their skin . under identity politics , it 's race that matters more than character , it 's gender that matters more than character , it 's sexual orientation that matters more than character , etc . identity politics is about valuing things like race over qualifications . identity politics is just another word for reverse discrimination , which is still discrimination . generally speaking , everyone tends to selfsort into groups based on similarity , and identity politics takes advantaged of that human tendency for tribalism , and urges people who share a group identity to vote as a bloc . that 's why black trump supporters like david a. clarke jr. and diamond and silk might be called traitors for not voting democrat , based on the idea that black people must vote democrat , even though it was the republican party that ended slavery in america . identity politics says since you 're blackwomanhispanicgaywhatever '' , then you must vote for this and this party democrat . that 's why peter thiel , who is gay , was attacked for being a trump supporter , and the advocate suggested he must not be gay then , because he did n't fall in line '' with the identity politics narrative . identity politics purports to be about equality , but it 's really about the worst kind of prejudicial thinking and stereotyping people based on how they look and therefore how they should vote , instead of letting people think for themselves , and have individual freedom .	db6e1r6	politics

you are correct , but the problem for the campaign is that the effort put forth to collect opposition research usually costs a campaign on the order of 1215k a month for someone like steele to collect . that means this information has a commercial value typically paid for by campaigns . that brings it under the narrow definition . he could absolutely have held a meeting with a russian lawyer and asked her to contribute her time to the campaign , but he could n't take the meeting to accept work product compiled by a foreign government .	dkb28xq	politics

her immigration status has nothing to do with don jr. , kushner , and manafort 's actions and motivations . hence it is irrelevant in understanding whether the trump campaign tried to collude with russia . now , if you want to get into the reasons the obama administration let her in , the article you posted mentions this she was granted immigration parole because she was defending a client in a us court . the u.s. attorney 's office for the southern district of new york granted veselnitskaya immigration parole in october 2015 , setting an expiration date of january 7 , 2016 , doj attorneys later told the court . on january 4 , veselnitskaya 's request to extend her parole was denied , according to a declaration filed in u.s. district court on january 5. in that filing , veselnitskaya asked the judge to allow her to remain in the u.s. to defend katsyv . she added she had been harassed by the government despite being paroled into the united states '' when trying to return from a trip to london that november . subsequent reporting URL indicates that she entered the country on a valid business b '' visa . in june 2016 , homeland said veselnitskaya was granted a bstatus nonimmigrant visa so she could conduct her legal work in the country . the claim about veselnitskaya is not that she is a spy . it is that she is a lawyer who represents the russian government . that is what goldstone said in his email . the us does not reject visas for foreign lawyers who represent their governments . so to sum it up she came in on a regularly issued b visa to meet the trump campaign the charge is not that she is a spy her immigration status on previous visits to defend a russian client has nothing to do with the trump campaign	dkjoubj	politics

he did n't speak at party events and stuff by accident . they wanted him to be up and coming , my pet theory is that obama was still expected to lose the 2008 primary , concede , and bring his voters along to hillary , thus giving her an in with all the demographics she 's really bad at campaigning for . when he won it kind of threw all the plans into chaos but they could n't exactly pass on a candidate with that level of draw .	drveqji	politics

last time i checked , trump is trying to do what he promised while getting blocked by dems . holy shit , check again , the republicans have a majority . he got the justice he wanted lol , he rubberstamped mitch 's pick . and they had to irrevocably damage our democracy to do it . awesome work . a single strike on syria to show assad what a red line looks like . what 's that , a damaged airstrip that was operational again the next day ? ? wow . getting china to put diplomatic pressure on north korea , has japan in talks for huge infrastructure projects , yuge . the yugest . he did n't get china to do anything . approved keystone right . that sucks . stopped funding for abortions overseas . not sure he actually campaigned on that , but yeah ... awesome win ... unemployment is down , consumer confidence is up , stock market is on a record streak thanks obama approved funding for flint michigan huh . well that 's a good one . withdrew from tpp probably a good one . has had listening sessions with almost all industries and demographics ... that 's a strange and vague claim . i 'm glad he 's had ... listening sessions . he 's about to damage the coal industry even though he promised to save it . illegal immigration is down i mean , how do you know ? it 's not like that 's actually tracked ... which is why it 's illegal ... but i agree that in general immigration is down . because trump has stirred up hatred for other races , so people do n't want to come here . awesome job , what a leader . he has gotten commitments from nato countries to start pulling their weight lol , do n't make things up has healthcare and tax plan in the works yeah , a budget that the democrats schooled him on and a healthcare plan that 's already failed again . which was also just another tax cut for the rich . will be renegotiating nafta , discovered chronic mismanagement and possibly fraudulent activity at hud do n't make things up . i am sure i am missing plenty . well yeah , you 're ignoring all the blatant corruption , nepotism , and bullshit eo 's he 's passed . but regardless , i think you did an excellent job of proving my point exactly . because go back through your list of shitty things he 's done and tell me how much he accomplished with actual legislation . how much is actually on the books as law and is n't just some easily reversed executive order ? because that would be actual work signing off on something so he can go golfing at his private club while we pay for all the travel and accommodation expenses is corrupt as fuck .	dhbdviv	politics

trust me i did n't piss away my vote . if my vote mattered , i do n't know what i would 've done , because all the candidates were awful . but i live in a place that clinton won by double digits , and my vote does n't count for shit . your vote only matters if you live in a swing state , fyi . i have never once insinuated monica thought a blowjob would advance her career . i said clinton promoted monica after she blew him . it was paula jones suing clinton , not monica . jones felt forced to perform sexual favors on clinton because he promoted women who blew him . monica was one of the women who blew him , then immediately got a promotion . which , naturally , made other women feel like they had to blow him if they wanted promotions . kind of a key point of the metoo movement . men in power do n't have to physically pin women down and rape them . they can just use their power to subtly let women know sexual favors are necessary for advancement . monica could 've very enthusiastically gotten on her knees and sucked the life out of him the fact that he immediately promoted her was a message to all the other women on how to get promoted , and that's why monica got involved in the lawsuit . she established a pattern .	dwcmolj	politics

the us geographically is larger than those nations put together . there is no home field advantage , other than , you know , to the people who live there . and what exactly do you think tyrannical oppression looks like ? its not soldiers posted in every street , its the squashing of dissent through night time raids when its your own government you do n't get that . its a whole different ball game . completely wrong . logistics trains still exist , and occupations inevitably require boots on the ground to enforce curfews , clear buildings of insurgents , and maintain order which is the bread and butter of insurgent guerillas . your argument literally goes against wargaming simulations. URL . an embedded and fully formented insurgent force in the us is basically a nightmare for our military . but yet none of those actions do anything other than frustrate the tyrant . you are n't talking out any military bases , you certainly arent storming the white house . the soldiers used will also be people you know , not some random foreigner . you gon na gun down your neighbour 's kid when he 's on his curfew patrol ? sure about that ? the government is already embedded . it already has supply lines and military superiority over the area . sure a guerrilla or two might cause a frustration but drones do n't give a fuck and they 'll firebomb your house from a hundred miles away , then send your family the bill . you really do n't know what you 're talking about . i know enough to know that its obviously a fantasy and the lives of kids is n't worth trading for it . also your thesis is from 2011 , and its just a thesis . im going to read through it carefully now and if it turns out i 'm wrong i shall be back to express that . edit i have read the thesis . insurgents are not going to overthrow a tyrannical government . their biggest worry is native american seperatists . at no point in the thesis does it discuss anything on the order of losing the war .	e5ddk8z	politics

see 2 14 characteristics of fascism umberto eco 1 the cult of tradition one has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers . the nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist , syncretistic , occult elements. 2 the rejection of modernism the enlightenment , the age of reason , is seen as the beginning of modern depravity . in this sense urfascism can be defined as irrationalism. 3 the cult of action for action s sake action being beautiful in itself , it must be taken before , or without , any previous reflection . thinking is a form of emasculation. 4 disagreement is treason the critical spirit makes distinctions , and to distinguish is a sign of modernism . in modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge. 5 fear of difference the first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders . thus urfascism is racist by definition. 6 appeal to social frustration one of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class , a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation , and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups. 7 the obsession with a plot the followers must feel besieged . the easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia. 8 the enemy is both strong and weak by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus , the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak. 9 pacifism is trafficking with the enemy for urfascism there is no struggle for life but , rather , life is lived for struggle. 10 contempt for the weak elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology. 11 everybody is educated to become a hero in urfascist ideology , heroism is the norm . this cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death. 12 machismo and weaponry machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits , from chastity to homosexuality. 13 selective populism there is in our future a tv or internet populism , in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the voice of the people. 14 urfascism speaks newspeak all the nazi or fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary , and an elementary syntax , in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning .	dzrfmes	politics

what i am saying is that this is t 100 on him of the republicans . i get that this is damn hard to fathom , but within the current tax law , the democrats could certainly have passed spending bills that didn t spend as much . while i am completely disgusted with trump and the republicans setting things up so that when there is another recession , there are few tools left to deal with it , i am also pissed at the democrats for not passing a bill to reverse the idiot tax cuts and to also maybe reduce fucking spending . which really is the problem here . maybe they should have reduced the defense budget by a bit . so , yeah , this is also partly on the democrats	fampxbk	politics

i assumed you meant that when they submitted their tax information to the irs each year , that their low wages put them far enough below the poverty line that they would n't pay taxes on it . which is why i said an american would n't pay either . but if they 're being paid less than minimum wage , would n't that problem also be solved if employers were held accountable for not paying a minimum wage ? i could be completely wrong and not have all the information , but are n't business owners essentially 100 responsible for illegal immigrants being able to get work even low wage jobs in the first place ? feels like the heat should be on them instead . i have a hard time blaming an immigrant , legal or illegal for trying to support their family . the immigrants in this case feel more like a symptom than a cause . again , i could be completely misinformed . i 'm just rattling off my opinion .	eebo2si	politics

the jobs created by automation are mid and high skill jobs . no they are n't . they open up more service jobs like construction , plumbing , electricians , and any other trade . anything that is n't easily automated becomes more valuable because you have the economic capacity to demand their labor . eitc and ubi are fixed value benefits which become less and less useful over time . they do n't have to be . you can fund eitc and ubi as a benefit proportional to tax revenue of a wealth tax or income tax for example and it will always be proportional to the size of the economy and dynamically adjust . i don t understand why liberals are willing to argue that it s somehow good and just to import and artificial lower class . for me i see it as a utilitarian position that makes immigrants and natives better off and more economically productive than keeping potential immigrants poorer and less productive in their native countries while reducing economic output of the american economy . there is no prolabor argument for low wages . nearly all recent studies of immigration shows that it raises median wages . you 're repeating truthy sounding arguments that are in opposition to the evidence . welcoming immigrants is not only moral , but good for the economy .	elsyd4s	politics

no , you like are n't getting it . basically because the senate and the house are counted for the electorate , it gives more power to states with lower populations . the electorate was created back in 1776 , where at the time , it was the best method to get people 's votes to the capitol . hell , voting is on a tuesday just so people do n't miss church on sunday , can travel on monday , vote on tuesday , travel again on wednesday , and still take their goods to the market on thursday . the problem is that we have n't kept our laws up with technology . people can now make it to a polling location in less than a day , even if they live in the most rural parts of the united states . literally , the senate was created to give all states equal voices when laws are passed , and the house so that there are laws that are representative of the population . that 's the balance . it should n't spill over into the way we elect the highest person in the country , because it 's not an accurate representation of the population .	efkelel	politics

yes it is the same . you make an assumption that it wasnt released to defend russia or wherever but its quite possible that he is n't able to substantiate his leaks which he does a lot or that hes waiting for maximum effect which he also clearly acknowledges is part of what he does or various other reasons . the reality is you simply dont know why or the what of what he does . us media tried to hide the clinton leaks for as long as it could stating that it was classified etc when it was happening . your argument does n't hold weight . remember the claim on cnn the public shouldnt read any leaks but unless cnn releases info about it and verifies it . how many of snowdens leaks were hidden for as long as possible or barely reported . it was known for at least a decade prior that the govt had tapped directly into at ts facilities for the nsa by whistleblowers did the media report on this ? barely to nothing . your claim really is ridiculous the more i think about it .

the russian investigation is over and has been proven to based on dubious pretenses at best and an agregious abuse of power at best . that will be officially proven very soon . 30 million dollars worth of oversight has already been performed and his campaign has been completely cleared of conspiring with russia . these further subpoenas are just a further abuse of power . i mean jesus christ , imagine if the bush administration doj and fbi got fisa warrants on obama s campaign , and then spent two years on a completely fruitless investigation into some made up conspiracy with a foreign government . imagine further , if you will , that when this investigation came up empty that republicans went on to try and pin obstruction of justice on him . how would that make you feel ? if the same exact events played out with obama , would you want him impeached too ?	elxo5td	politics

110 check out thephilosophersmememk24 on insta . my favorite account he does live discussions a ton , as well i opt out of livestreaming type of media but he 's very active . a.n.a.r.c.h.i.s.t is another good one , as well as thesurrealbank . i have read over much of the chomsky interview . i enjoy that he demarcates anarchy from 'no rules at all ' , to a philosophy that covers a wide , but not limitless or without rule , set of ideas . right away that scores points with me . his example of the israeli kibbutzim society as a strong example of sustain anarchiststyle of rule resonates very strongly with me selfmanagement , direct worker control , integration of agriculture , industry , service , personal participation in selfmanagement . while i 'm admittedly ignorant to his more modern examples , such as the spanish revolution of 1936 , they 're inroads that i shall travel down to learn what has happened in the past , and how we may come back to more individual freedom and less coercion by force . there 's so much to unpack , i feel a comment reply wo n't do it justice . my top critique however , is that i am a subscriber to the belief that laws are only valid when enforceable . perhaps this is n't irreconcilable with his later explanations of the framework he does embody a system that is local at heart and power , yet federated regionally and beyond . i did n't note the date the interview took place until about a quarter of the way through . what 's surprised me is how well aged these arguments are . i ca n't quite put to words yet how that made me feel both satisfied that i feel i am on the path to truth , and dissatisfied that we 've imo marginalized at best or forcefully pushed out at worst these ideals , claiming anarchy is extremist . after reading this interview , i 've come away with a very different view of how plausible a true limited government federation could be this perhaps may be the framework that i can build my house on . certainly was a pleasure to read . thank you , thank you , thank you .	ekqrjba	politics
