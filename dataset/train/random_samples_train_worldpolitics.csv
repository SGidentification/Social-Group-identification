reread the part you quoted . you 're not understanding it correctly . the greater israel '' zionist expansionism plan is precisely to keep the palestinians in a state of genocide and misery , living like dogs , until iraq was ready to give to jordan , and jordan to the palestinians . the likudniksshas israelis and settlers have absolutely no intention of having any arabs in israel , and have a long term plan to achieve this . in palestine , for instance , all center of higher education have been closed . students are n't allowed to even leave to study abroad . mosques and orphanages have been closed recently , for no reason other than security . '' shit flows in the streets bringing with it disease , and israel pumps its own shit into palestine . they are constantly in a state of nearstarvation , ca n't work , ca n't move about because of checkpoints , and ca n't even visit their own coastline because it might upset the psychotic settlers from brookyln . you should educate yourself on what is actually going on there . then you would understand just how deeply and intentionally it is genocide . the racist hate for arabs is so intense especially among the settlers , and the iof has free reign to do whatever they want with morally challenged troops .

from wikipedia many of shoebat 's claims about his background have come under suspicion of inaccuracy . in addition to the lack of evidence to support his claim of bombing bank leumi , his account of the alleged incident has been inconsistent . furthermore , while he claims to have changed his name to hide his identity , his family , members of the shoebat family in bethlehem , deny this to be true and are mystified '' by his claims . 7 an article on electronic intifada , a propalestinian website , describes him as a member of a fanatic '' sect referring to his particular evangelical christian church who makes blatantly racist declarations against islam '' and believes that adherents to most christian denominations are false christians '' 8 . sheila musaji said of shoebat that this is an extremist christian terrorist . this is not a former terrorist . this is a man who used to hate jews and now hates muslims , who used to commit violence against jews and now justifies violence against muslims . 9 in an article published in internet magazine counterpunch in 2004 , will youmans noted that shoebat had never come under criminal investigation in the us for his alleged terrorist activities , nor had he been threatened with deportation , although two other palestinians in the us had faced deportation proceedings because of their alleged involvement with terrorist groups . youmans claims that shoebat is effectively immune from prosecution or deportation because of his proisrael views . he also argues that shoebat 's religious convictions , including the belief that jews will be forced to accept christ or perish in hell '' when the rapture comes , are intrinsically antisemitic . furthermore , youmans contends that shoebat 's beliefs are incompatible with efforts towards peace , because of the premillennial , dispensational doctrine that the second coming of christ will be hastened by conflict in the middle east . 10 URL	c03n0qc	worldpolitics

i tried to submit it to politics , but it already was submitted a year ago , and did n't get any votes . it seems even more pertinent today , so i gave it another shot . fta here is senator mccarthy , speaking in june 1951 about the parlous situation of the united states how can we account for our present situation unless we believe that men high in this government are concerting to deliver us to disaster ? this must be the product of a great conspiracy on a scale so immense as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man . a conspiracy of infamy so black that , which it is finally exposed , its principals shall be forever deserving of the maledictions of all honest men.what can be made of this unbroken series of decisions and acts contributing to the strategy of defeat ? they can not be attributed to incompetence.the laws of probability would dictate that part of the decisions would serve the country s interest . now turn back fifty years to a manifesto signed in 1895 by a number of leaders of the populist party as early as 186566 a conspiracy was entered into between the gold gamblers of europe and america.for nearly thirty years these conspirators have kept the people quarreling over less important matters while they have pursued with unrelenting zeal their one central purpose.every device of treachery , every resource of statecraft , and every artifice known to the secret cabals of the international gold ring are being used to deal a blow to the prosperity of the people and the financial and commercial independence of the country . next , a texas newspaper article of 1855 it is a notorious fact that the monarchs of europe and the pope of rome are at this very moment plotting our destruction and threatening the extinction of our political , civil , and religious institutions . we have the best reasons for believing that corruption has found its way into our executive chamber , and that our executive head is tainted with the infectious venom of catholicism.the pope has recently sent his ambassador of state to this country on a secret commission , the effect of which is an extraordinary boldness of the catholic church throughout the united states.these minions of the pope are boldly insulting our senators reprimanding our statesmen propagating the adulterous union of church and state abusing with foul calumny all governments but catholic , and spewing out the bitterest execrations on all protestantism . the catholics in the united states receive from abroad more than 200,000 annually for the propagation of their creed . add to this the vast revenues collected here. it should all sound pretty familiar if you 've spent much time on reddit . i had no idea how far back some of these rightwing conspiracy theories went . sad .	c06aqse	worldpolitics

i remember when i was a kid my dad telling me about this book he read . i do n't remember the title , but the ninth planet comes to mind . anyways , from what he told me ... there is an earth like planet that orbits the sun every thousand years . he said we humans are all a test , that we were created by these beings on this other planet . every so often they visit us ufos to check our progress . the wheel was put into our possession to see what we 'd achieve with it , for example . this little tidbit of information was supposedly found on these clay tablets , in a cave off of s. africa . now , i 'm only repeating this from memory and i 'm prolly wrong about some of it , but there are a few things that struck me 1. on these clay tablets were drawings of stick figure men standing on discs ... in the air the tablets were supposedly thousands of years old , too . 2. the egyptians built the pyramids to provide a landing spot for the visitorsoverlords , etc . 3. according to the tablets , the next time the planet is supposed to orbit back this way is 2012 . 4. this is perhaps the most interesting these overlords would take some of us with them and bring them back when they cycled back through . supposedly , you or i would only age one of their years ... a year on their planetary cycle and when we came back to earth , we were 1000 years older , according to earth 's orbiting cycle . this could explain how people lived to be 500600 years old in the bible something the book points out . i never read the book , i 'm only going on what my dad told me about 20 years ago .	c06h07s	worldpolitics

so you are drawling parallel between israel preventing palestinians '' to create a new nation and iran threatening to wipe out a nation . you think wiping out a nation using a bomb is not letting separatists to carve out a state . ? hence you believe prevention of statehood massacring millions . is israel any different from china india us and many other nations for not allowing separatists to achieve separate statehood ? israel keeps 3million palestinians stateless . i understand you might not care at all about that , but the fact that you do n't care about that tells us about you and your moral stance . truth is i do n't recognize so called palestinians , i do n't recognize their ownership over any land . i see them no different from any other arabs . they were not having the title palestinians '' before the arrival of jews , and the migrated in droves from neighboring region over the years just like jews . no body have a claim to any land in this world , and the muslims do n't have high moral pedestal when they have stolen land from non muslims all over the world . if you want jews to give back your land , then kindly ask muslims to give back land all over the world to the non muslims that they have captured just like jews . and , how much land does arabs need for themselves . do arabic states have shortage for land ? if not then why are n't they palestinians moving back to any neighboring arab state ? btw what is the difference between palestinians and lebanese people . or a arabic phrase meaning something else was translated into an english idiom with a different meaning URL wrong , its translation is disputed and because millions of life are at stake and due to iran 's past and present antics i wo n't give them benefit of doubt . do you believe that iran is about to commit suicide by attacking a nuclear armed israel ? do you really believe that ? i do n't have a crystal ball , going by what some iranians leaders have threatened to do yes there is a possibility . but that is not the only reason why i think iran 's nuclear warhead development should be stopped . i fear that neighboring sunni states will also start their own programs . and i do n't think that would be good for world stability . do you believe that iran is about to commit suicide by attacking a nuclear armed israel ? do you really believe that ? why are you repeating this ? have n't i replied to this already . ?	c0e1614	worldpolitics

what is wrong is using the religious status of the other side as part of your argument . wtf , i wrongly thought that he was palestinian that is why i used the word you '' , his religion was not part of the argument , in fact the whole muslim community was part of the argument . and the reason why their religion is being dragged into this is because they are asking for state on religious grounds and they are claiming that the land belongs to them and not jews . and because jews did what muslims and others have done all over the world , i am asking them to return land from all the nonmuslims . this is how settlement process happens , if you find that racist then you have some serious misunderstand of that particular word . it is infuriating and totally illogical that you can accuse as racist for that . the reason i accused you of being a racist is because of your comment that disagreed with with my statement that ethnicity should not be used as a reason for attacking the argument of another person . either way , no matter how you may feel about it ethnicity is not a race , and what makes you think that i attacked him using ethnicity ? he is accusing israelis for wrong doing , on ethnic grounds and want land returned on ethnic ground and i am giving a proposed solution on ethnic ground which is fair . what in that seems to you racist '' ? i never said that israel wiped out another nation . i said they may have tried to . that is bad enough in your flexible ways . i consider judging people based on their ethnicity racism . people who are pleading to the world for a nation state on ethnic ground , their case would be judged on ethnic grounds . whether you like it or not . i consider judging people based on their ethnicity racism . obviously racism is just a word so you can define it so that judging people based on their ethnicity is not racism . but either way it is a terrible thing to do . you judged me on judging people on ethnic grounds because they are judging jews on ethnic ground and want world to judge jews as bad and as you can see that so much judgment is going on ... i can judge you as a very terrible person . what you are failing to understand is that arabs and jews are judging each other and are asking world for judgment on this issue on ethnic grounds as they are asking for nationhood on ethnic grounds . why do you think people wont judge them on ethnic grounds ? no matter what you say , but resorting to frivolous accusations is ignominious .	c0e1sjo	worldpolitics

the point the author makes about women 's rights being used as propaganda is true , but everything else she says shows a fundamental misunderstanding about what 's going on in afghanistan . we should stop fighting because we 're killing people with airstrikes . '' okay yes , ending aggressions there would avoid that , but it 's misleading to suggest this is some sort of inevitable consequence of us fighting there . anyone who knows about war will tell you that airstrikes are meant as support for ground forces , however we have so few troops on the ground that airstrikes are being used as a replacement . one big problem with this is that fewer ground forces results in less field intelligence , something required for accurate strikes . all those airstrikes that target weddings and stuff by mistake have been the result of poor intelligence . adding more ground forces would virtually eliminate these civilian casualties not all , just crazy wedding bombardment ones . the other big issue here is this whole women have it worse now as we 've blown everything up and let crazy people take over '' sentiment . again , this is also true , but it is pretty naive to think that pulling out and switching gears to humanitarianism will suddenly fix everything . warlords are in power , if we back out they will stay in power . if we give them money to fix their plumbing , if we give them food and supplies , that will all go to the warlords , not the people . if you want to send people over to physically build things themselves , well they are a sovereign country and will probably refuse . for an example of how this sort of thing works see sri lanka . i 'm not saying we need to fight there , but to paint this region with so simple a brush is just plain wrong .	c0b0nae	worldpolitics

'' in the united states , it is actually rather difficult to steal an election because of our federalist system , elections are monitored and voting totals are reported by hundreds or thousands of individual officials at the state , county , and precinct levels . there is therefore a rather substantial marginal cost to stealing additional votes you have to recruit some number of additional people into the conspiracy , and hope they do n't rat you out or leave some kind of paper trail that makes obvious your intention . '' there might be some truth to this with older paper or machine voting systems , but with digital voting systems this notion of security through diversity '' is not true at all . the security of commercially available systems is appalling and breathtakingly simple to crack and hack . in the state of georgia the only ballots that can be recounted are the paper absentee ballots . there simply is no paper trail . there are hundreds of ways for state and local administrators to marginalize voter turnout it only takes a few key officials to rig an election . more information on electronic voting machine security here URL	c0afgh0	worldpolitics

absolutely not a coup . keep in mind , first and foremost that us citizens and other honduran outsiders are most likely to interpret these events through their own constitution . honduras is not the us . their constitution is hugely different . see the honduras constitution URL and an english interpretation of the relevant phrasing here article 42 , section five of the honduras constitution states roughly translated that any person inciting , promoting , or supporting the continuation or reelection of the president may lose hisher citizenship , by court order . URL take note of the events leading up to the president 's removal URL . this is another critical fact he could n't get the ballots published in the country ! he had to have chavez print them in venezuala and ship them to him ! honduran printers knew their constitution well enough to understand the enormous risk they would run in printing them they could lose their citizenship ! as military coups '' go , the one this weekend in honduras was strangely , well , democratic . the military did n't oust president manuel zelaya on its own but instead followed an order of the supreme court . it also quickly turned power over to the president of the honduran congress , a man from the same party as mr. zelaya . the legislature and legal authorities all remain intact . '' wsj URL '' it 's not surprising that chavistas throughout the region are claiming that he was victim of a military coup . they want to hide the fact that the military was acting on a court order to defend the rule of law and the constitution , and that the congress asserted itself for that purpose , too . '' wsj URL '' honduran supreme court said it had ordered the removal of the president , who had been due to leave office next january .

realistically , that may be the case , but the moment the ltte acknowledges as much , their motive as a group drops out the bottom . if they started to think that they could never gain international recognition as an independent state , then their unity would disintegrate and they 'd fall apart as a movement . so it makes sense to assume that they do n't regard it as out of the question . as for why they 're keeping the u.n. in the war zone , the reason would seem to be that they 're hoping that either the sri lankan military will be less eager to attack if they know international casualties are probable , or they 're hoping that the international community will see sri lankan 's attacking or injuring neutral parties and bring external pressure to bear . which is , perhaps , an indication of just how desperate the ltte is at this point . they are , apparently , willing to sacrafice standing with the u.n. for the possibility of indicting the sri lankan military post factum . the u.n. protest effectively undercuts that indictment by turning the blame back on the ltte .	c077g4z	worldpolitics

who is in the possession of the disappeared '' eight indestructible black boxes on those four flights ? they were probably destroyed . this was a scenario they simply were n't designed to survive . if they were recovered , there are sensible reasons that they not be made public , anyway . do you want the operative in egypt that the hijackers discussed in the cockpit to know you 're on to him ? considering multiple international red alerts about a possible terrorist attack inside the us including former secretary of state condoleezza rice 's infamous august 6 , 2001 , memo how come four hijacked planes deviating from their computerized flight paths and disappearing from radar are allowed to fly around us airspace for more than an hour and a half not to mention disabling all the elaborate pentagon 's defense systems in the process ? many flights disappear from radar '' while on normal routes . should the pentagon have shot them all down ? i do n't have a clue what disabling all the elaborate pentagon 's defense systems '' means . norad was n't designed for this . none of their systems were designed to evaluate and counteract an attack of this nature . why the secretary of the us air force james roche did not try to intercept both planes hitting the wtc only seven minutes away from mcguire air force base in new jersey as well as the pentagon only 10 minutes away from mcguire ? roche had no less than 75 minutes to respond to the plane hitting the pentagon . because no one knew which planes were involve and our command and control systems were inadequate to communicate the relevant information to the right people and enact the proper response . this was a highly unusual situation , and it 's not surprising that no one ordered his planes to go up and start blowing up commercial airliners at random . why did george w bush continue to recite my pet goat '' in his florida school and was not instantly absconded by the secret service ? the first collision was n't understood to be an attack until some time after the president finished . you ca n't rush the president out of the room every time a crisis happens or you 'd be doing it constantly . how could bush have seen the first plane crashing on wtc live as he admitted ? did he have previous knowledge or is he psychic ? bush said he saw the plane hit the tower '' . knowing bush 's mastery of english grammar , is n't it possible he meant to say saw the plane had hit the tower '' ? that change of tense is something we do in offthecuff speaking all the time . bush said that he and andrew card initially thought the first hit on the wtc was an accident with a small plane . how is that possible when the faa as well as norad already knew this was about a hijacked plane ? again , the u.s. government is huge , and effective , high signaltonoise communication from one of its many tendrils to another is a nontrivial problem . unlike what you see on t.v. , the head of the faa does n't just pick up a phone and say , get me the president ! '' every time there 's a serious incident with a u.s. aircraft . what are the odds of transponders in four different planes be turned off almost simultaneously , in the same geographical area , very close to the nation 's seat of power in washington , and no one scrambles to contact the pentagon or the media ? there are dozens of reasons why ground stations might not be receiving transponder signals from planes , and unless you 're already at high alert and expecting an attack like this , it 's probably an insignificantly interesting event when you consider the hundreds of planes operating along the bostondc corridor every day . could defense secretary donald rumsfeld explain why initial media reports said that there were no fighter jets available at andrews air force base and then change the reports that there were , but not on high alert ? because the media always gets things right the first time in a crisis situation ... why was the dc air national guard in washington awol on 911 ? i do n't think he really means awol '' in an official sense . regardless , the dc air national guard did n't fly a lot of combat patrols over dc prior to 911 ... why did combat jet fighters of the 305th air wing , mcguire air force base in new jersey not intercept the second hijacked plane hitting the wtc , when they could have done it within seven minutes ? again , command , control and communication issues . the armed forces is n't the borg , thinking with one mind . seven minutes is an eternity to come up with a plan and get the authorization all the way from the top to execute it , particularly when this was a rather novel scenario . why did none of the combat jet fighters of the 459th aircraft squadron at andrews air force base intercept the plane that hit the pentagon , only 16 kilometers away ? and since we 're at it , why the pentagon did not release the full video of the hit ? ditto , and as to the pentagon , i 'm not sure what he means , but even if he 's right that there 's secret video '' , it 's well within national security norms not to disclose more information than necessary about your vital facilities .	c0d23t8	worldpolitics

wrong . leaders are elected , but they have to make it through their party 's list generation processes first . further , with this particular government , the party that got the very most votes kadima was excluded from the coalition . a lot of israelis who agree with tzipi livni and believe that the only way to safeguard the future of the state is to create a state where palestinians can live in peace feel particularly disenfranchised right now . thanks for buying into apartheid week , you gullible llama . israel is nothing like south africa was . in south africa , blacks could n't hold government jobs or vote , or bring suit against whites or against the government . israel extends citizenship to arabspalestinians within its borders , and lets them vote and run for office . there are arab parties in the knesset and the chief justice of the supreme court is arab as well . and , arabs are employed in large volumes by the government , especially in terms of development projects in areas with high concentrations of arab populations . israel actually takes pains to preserve its liberal democratic character even though most of the arab population opposes its existence . i 'm definitely not an extremist . i met with a woman who was an israeli settler evacuated from gaza in 2005 and i told her that i thought that she had no business settling there in the first place . but israelis have a right to their own country just like everyone else , and above that they have a right to pursue security policy however they see fit , and they should be granted some latitude in that due to the extreme circumstances they have to deal with on a day to day basis . everyone said the security barrier was dehumanizing but its implementation cut off the flow of suicide bombers to israeli cities . you tell me what 's more moral than protecting your citizenry . i am suspicious that you do n't know exactly what you 're criticizing the israeli government for . i think that when you look at the palestinians , you only see what they want you to see or what you want to see . you do n't see hamas violence against christians or palestinian infighting , and you do n't see the tactics they used during cast lead . you 've probably forgotten the reason why israel went in to gaza for cast lead in the first place . and you 've probably forgotten that those circumstances were the direct result of israel 's decision to pull out of the gaza strip four years prior to that . you who claim to have a perspective driven by reason are exposed to be nothing more than determinedly antizionist . you do n't care about evidence , or reality , or anything but the dominant narrative you contribute to . if you do n't know , do n't speak .	c0m51xb	worldpolitics

that 's just it , this is n't oblique . this mosque has been discovered to promote violent ideology and has inspired terrorism . that 's not in question . the first sentence of the article reads as follows hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported . this mosque is n't like the mosques you and i might visit , where islam is taught as a religion instead of a violent cause . the point i was making in my original post was that there 's a marked difference from the free teaching of islam , which absolutely should be protected , and the teaching of violent jihad , which is not a freedom of religion issue . freedom of religion is about the ability to worship your god or gods or not worship any god without having to worry about the state forcing you to stop or worship another god or gods . it 's not about allowing you to do whatever you want under the banner of religion . let 's not lose sight of that .	c0whwuc	worldpolitics

we are here before muhammad '' the jews did n't own that land for more than 500 years during the last millennium . the muslims have owned it for 1100 of the last 1300 years . i really do n't understand the fundamentalist jewish claim to the land . outside of the bible , that is . at least that makes sense in its own weird way . the last time westerners conquered the holy land '' , the muslims took their sweet ass time noticing , caring , then taking it back . but they eventually did after nearly 200 years . and that 's after the christians slaughtered the crap out of everyone in doing so . considering we 're 40 years into the conquest of east jerusalem by israel , it seems pretty clear that unless israel justifies its existence to its muslim neighbors , they 're simply going to take it back before 2100. i do n't think there 's going to be a genocide or something crazy , they 'll just take back ownership , and most of the jews will probably stick around unlike when they took over in '48 and chased out many palestinians . this also highlights the relative insanity of the united states and other western countries for trying to prop up a country more like a colony in such a hostile environment at such a huge expense to themselves .	c0rjaod	worldpolitics

the original article was somewhat unclear , so i found a conflicting article from the other side URL that explains what the counterstory is . i imagine this little conflict might be very easy to solve for anybody with access to some historic aerialsatellite imagery . in recent days , however , there has been much hustle and bustle in the cemetery , and its seems to be growing from day to day , cutting into land that is a part of independence park . trucks , tractors and other heavy machines come and go , dumping building materials , which workers then shape into muslimstyle tombstones with no one buried beneath them . dozens of these fauxgraves are being created on the eastern end of the park , in row after row , where only bare earth and grassy areas existed until now . makes me think of israeli settlements , except not as useful to whomever is doing it .	c0w7mj6	worldpolitics

i do n't think their actions are acceptable i found the video disturbing to watch . i agree with you that , from my limited understanding , they violated rules of engagement . most egregious to me was the firing upon those coming to aid the wounded . however , it is easy in hindsight to convict people when at the time the decision would not have been so clear . the facts are that this was in baghdad in 2007 at the height of the insurgency , and that a us patrol was being fired upon near to this location . in my opinion , the cameras did look like guns , and sadly in baghdad at that time i am sure guns and rpg 's were more commonly being carried around than expensive slr 's with giant lenses . i imagine it was especially troubling for the apache crew to see one of the individuals lean around the corner of a building holding this rpg '' on his shoulder . that looked a lot like someone readying to fire to me . for those reasons i believe this was a sad but certainly not unique case of twitchy nerves resulting in civilian deaths in a warzone . i strongly disagree with m0dquark 's assertion that this was target practice '' .	c0nmx59	worldpolitics

well , since you took the time to ask , the jewish world is divided into groups . the first major schism is betweem ashkenazim and sephardim . the difference here is basically eastern european jews vs mediterrannean and middle eastern jews . there are differences in celebration , ethnicity , interpretations of the halakah jewish law , etc . then there are the sects . there is orthodoxy which is further divided into orthodox , ultraorthodox , chassidim , and several other groups which is the stereotypical looking jew you see in comedy routines and the like . the men always wear head coverings and will often have the hanging locks of hair at their temples though not always . this group is the most literal in their interpretation of jewish law and the strictest in enforcement of standards for whether or not someone is jewish . in the us , this group is maybe 10 of all jews with the worldwide total being somewhat higher than that but not by much . it is primarily this group of jews that supports israel almost unilaterally due to the religious belief that they will rebuild the temple and reestablish the premodern method of celebrating judaism that is basically a sacrificial cult . on the other end of the scale are the reform jews which i happen to be . they are progressive and insist on interpreting the entire scope of jewish law through the lens of modernism . they allow for women and homosexuals to be clergy instead of limiting it to straight men . they perform gay marriage . while the official stance of the urj is supportive of israel as a concept they have , on several occasions , condemned specific actions taken by the israeli government which is a pretty big deal for a jewish institution . they comprise anywhere between 4055 of the us population depending on who you ask with somewhat smaller populations worldwide . between the reform movement and the orthodox movement is the conservative movement . they were formed after the reform movement changed one too many things about orthodox judaism . the conservative movement basically walks the same line as the reform movement , but to a lesser degree . they are still strict about some things , but are loosening up in other areas i hear they have ordained female rabbis now . as you can see , there are a wide variety of beliefs . most importantly to your point though , is how they interpret whether or not a person is jewish . for instance , as a convert in the reform movement , i am not immediately recognized as being jewish by the orthodox movement . specifically , i am not recognized by the israeli courts orthodox that oversee the right of return . i could get an exception since the curriculum i followed was approved by a local orthodox rabbi and i followed a bunch of reformoptional '' rituals . to the rest of the world , i am fully jewish . to the jews in israel i might be able to get in on a technicality . my own rabbi is another good example . he is proisrael . i am against it 's current policies and do n't have much of an opinion about it 's existence as a country . he knows this and we discuss it quite often , but he has never made me feel less than welcome at my temple , nor have any of the other folks that i have spoken with this matter about . as a jew who stays abreast of modern progressive jewish ideals , i can tell you that israel is a complex situation and that even among jews there is n't universal support for it 's policies or even for the concept of israel as a country .	c0vfb5r	worldpolitics

i ca n't necessarily agree with everything that you 've said ... the american revolution took place only 235 years ago , and yet americans do n't have a deep seeded hatred for the british . the us civil war took place even later than that , but the north and south it could be argued that certain subgroups still hold on to old sentiments are n't at each other 's throats . in the cases of the american indian and afroamerican genocide and enslavement , the us did everything in its power to dismantle their entire society , culture and heritage ... which is what i think china is doing to tibet today . when the mongols , japanese , and tibetans were trying to siege china centuries ago , it was because that was the nature of politics at that time . war was what determined borders and sovereignty . today , china could demolish tibet in a month if it felt like it could get away with it . they do n't fear losing their sovereignty to tibet or whatever ancient wounds '' they may have experienced hundreds of years ago that 's probably the furthest thing from their minds , but they do fear experiencing backlash from the rest of the world .	c0kwhrx	worldpolitics

ron paul is not an individualist . he is in many cases for state 's rights over individual rights . it 's just a version of collectivism on a smaller scale . states rightsindividual rights in american politics not necessarily . an individualist may be for privatization of the environment , so if there is pollution on x person 's property than x person can sue for the damages . this is basically free market environmentalism in a nutshell , the premise is that privatization of property will lead to a better preservation of the environment and it is completely congruent with individualist ideals . that does n't take into account y people who have to deal with the effects of the pollution and have no recourse , the ability of x people to bring suit , or a long list of other things . this is the fallacy of the free market . not to mention , there was definitely better care of communal property . remember the closure of the commons ? there are a lot of caveats in trying to reduce economics to a leftright '' spectrum . one can be for free markets , but still for a collective social order , they just do n't want to impose this social order by means of government . maybe if you went to look at the chart it would give you some understanding . it is n't the nolan , a bit more simple that allows for easy comparison . economics , while not totally a left right divide , can be essentially broken down into two main camps . what theory you believe in is economic . how you think it should be imposed is the social aspect and the other axis of the chart . i do n't see the two as dependent . see , that is the problem . the individual and community are inherently dependent . one can not exist without the other . the needs of both need to be weighed together , which is collectivist thought . i think we have to now agree that the individualistcollectivist divide is not always so clear . i think it is n't clear to you .	c0xhqhm	worldpolitics

much as i dislike netanyahu and his government , the quotes here do n't really go beyond the kind of manoeuvring one might expect of any somewhat devious politician . a broad attack on the palestinian authority . to bring them to the point of being afraid that everything is collapsing the world won t say a thing . the world will say we re defending . you might say he 's being deceptive since he called it an attack while counting on others calling it a defence . but he 's answering his interlocutor 's question , which was specifically about what the world will think of his attack . his assessment is , unfortunately , pragmatic and accurate . i know what america is . america is something that can easily be moved . moved to the right direction . ... they won t get in our way . they won t get in our way . again , it 's hardly surprising that netanyahu sees how loyal an ally the us is , and how this gives him the freedom to manoeuvre . and again , his assessment is accurate . so let s say they say something . so they said it ! they said it ! 80 of the americans support us . it s absurd . we have that kind of support and we say what will we do with the what he 's calling absurd is not the level of american support but for israeli politicians to fear a us response when israel has that level of us support . this relates to the previous point he 's being pragmatically rational . look . that administration clinton was extremely propalestinian . i wasn t afraid to maneuver there . i was not afraid to clash with clinton . i was not afraid to clash with the united nations . i was paying the price anyway , i preferred to receive the value . value for the price . nothing particularly surprising about this either . netanyahu was prepared to clash with the us and un when he thought the benefits outweighed the costs . this is how politicians think all the time . these quotes only show that netanyahu is a cynical politician like so many others . i do n't suppose the reasoning of highup politicians in the us , uk or any other typical western country is much , if any , less cynical . i could not understand the video so i do n't know whether there were more damning revelations therein . and let me reiterate i 'm not generally defending netanyahu and have many criticisms of his government . i just think this particular conversation is getting overhyped .	c0uowtg	worldpolitics
huh , this is pretty interesting . for some reason i never thought of this being a peace solution . both sides know exactly what it takes to get peace . the question is are they willing to do it . recent events point towards israel not being the one willing to work toward peace . if they defy the needs of us national security , then an option of recognizing palestine as an independent state should be on obama 's table . if we do it , lots will join in and force everyone back to the negotiating table to settle it once and for all . any thoughts on negative consequences of this ?	c15211l	worldpolitics

the realization of the aspiration '' has been extremely violent and has led to the death and ethnic cleansing and people living in apartheid conditions for millions of people . we disagree about what the realization has led to , but here at least you acknowledge it is not zionism itself , but its realization . if it was merely a peaceful aspiration the world would be a better place . and here you again regress to the wrong notion again that the aspiration itself is a problem , and not the realization or implementation in practice . zionism is a violent idea . it is an ultranationalist idea that is as bad as the horrible ultranationalist ideologies of nazism and fascism . no , zionism is just an aspiration for a jewish homeland . there 's nothing violent or ultranationalist '' about wanting a homeland . zionism is the idea that one group of people should be allowed to take the land of others to do so by ethnic cleansing , murder and apartheid policies . no , it is n't . zionism is not about taking the land of others , there simply was n't any empty land so creating a homeland will necessarily mean immigrating to a land with a people . zionism was all about peacefully coexisting with the population that had to happen to be where the jewish homeland will get set up , and a place was chosen were there was no statehood , and was relatively empty just a few hundred thousand people over the whole area . what jewsisraelis did from 1947 and forward has been the stealing of land . in 1947 before israel was created jews owned only 6 of the land . the rest has been stolen . well , by 1947 the arabs in palestine have created a violent conflict . when land is taken in a violent conflict it is called war '' , and not land stealing '' . if a country attacks b country and loses land to b , it is not considered land theft by b unless b is israel ? . so because there have been worse murders in history it 's okay to murder children and civilians ? that 's known as the serialkiller defense , other people have murdered so murder is fine . when you make claims like that you really look like an idiot . no , that 's not the claim i made . are you intentionally misreading or do you lack reading comprehension ? you said what israel did was as bad '' . i showed that what israel did was not nearly as bad '' . so now you say just because it is n't as bad , it is ok ?

evil troll well there have been numerous identical twin experiments which show intelligence is effected by genetics . there 's also been experiments on cognition and south african people score less than asians . even once those two races are put together in the same school the differences get less , but continue to exist . evil troll advanced logical reasoning , abstract thought and complex spatial awareness are n't vital in surviving in africa , were food is plentiful , and winters mild . running fast is . south africans have more fasttwich fibres than asians . so it 's reasonable to expect other inheritable attributes like the ones mentioned above to run along genetic lines . also , race is n't just skin deep '' . south africans ca n't donate organs to white people and viceversa ... the body organs are not compatible . obviously these are statistical differences and look where we are when we mention paedophiles are nearly always men . nothing good can come of the generalisation because the dumb public think a very slight distribution skew suddenly means rock solid proof of an absolute . again , like british airways not allowing men to fly sitting next to a child with who 'm they 're not related . israel may be spouting hyperbole , and using a most heinous slight statistical difference , but they 're hoping the public will generalise as sadly , with their argument being based in a misunderstanding of facts and statistics the public see their statement as fact also . in a society every individual is unique , and you can never tell how intelligent a person is whom your talking to based on a cultural analysis . the variance is huge . black people may be born with more fast twitch fibres than white people but in an average environment those minor genetic differences are far outweighed by the variance in each individual ... such as in a school race ...	c0sy3dd	worldpolitics

no , thats not it , because the socialists did very well in 1994 , 2002 and 2006. what happened since is not just the economic crisis , which would make any government impopular . it was in particular that thenparty leader and prime minister gyurcsany gave a speech to a meeting of his own party edit in 2006 , which was then leaked , in which he admitted that they had lied to win that year 's elections , had in fact done nothing but lied for two years about the economy , and had no idea what they were doing . some choice quotes no european country has done something as boneheaded as we have . obviously , we lied throughout the last yearandahalf , two years . and and meanwhile we 've done nothing for four years . nothing . and i almost perished because i had to pretend for 18 months that we were governing . instead , we lied morning , night and evening . et cetera . coming in an atmosphere of intense political polarization between conservatives and socialists who can drink each other 's blood , coming just after heavily contested elections , and coming in a society where historical recriminations about the country 's communist past make divisions far more personal and intense than they would be in the west , this was enough to drive thousands of people to the street to riot and ransack the building of the national television . more here URL'sspeechinbalaton c5 91sz c3 b6dinmay2006 and here URL . gyurcsany nevertheless stayed on in office and as party leader for another three years . during these years the situation was compounded by a number of corruption scandals , some on a local rather than national level but most involving governing socialists or their allies the free democrats . the former mayor of my city district is now in jail , as is the number 2 of budapest 's public transport company . it 's a bit of a clusterfuck for the country 's left . the socialists have not recovered and are not likely to soon among the country 's younger generations , the far right jobbik are now more popular than they are . the free democrats have disintegrated altogether , and are not in the chart because they are polling at 0 . there 's a new party called politics can be different which has profiled itself as a kind of green , radically democratic party , and made an impressive enough debut for such a niche party with 2.6 of the vote in the european elections . but it is very much an eclectic patchwork of groups from across the political spectrum , and seems more of a party for cultural niches than a mainstream party with a credible claim to major party status .	c0lsr35	worldpolitics

ethnonationalism remains the main political force in our era . in disuniting of america reflections on a multicultural society URL arthur schlesinger writes that '' nationalism remains after two centuries the most vital political emotion in the world far more vital than social ideologies such a communism or fascism or even democracy . ... within nationstates , nationalism takes the form of ethnicity or tribalism . '' peace and stability came to europe only after its empires were dissolved , by then the peoples of europe had sorted themselves out and each achieved its own home . ethnonationalism may be a precondition of liberal democracy . only after all the tribes of europe had their own ethnically homogenous nationstates did peace and comity come . and what happened in europe in the 20th century may be a precursor of what is to come in latin america , the middle east , africa and asia . in china , uighurs , mongolians and tibetans all resist assimilation . tatarstan may be the next problem for russia . in the balkans , it is kosovo . serbs there and in bosnia may emulate the albanians and secede . americans , find ethnonationalism discomfiting both intellectually and morally . social scientists go to great lengths to demonstrate that this is a product not of nature but of culture . but none of this will make ethnonationalism go away . indeed , we see it bubbling up from the basque country of spain , to belgium , bolivia , baghdad and beirut . perhaps the wisest counsel for the united states may be to get out of the way of this elemental force . rather than seek to halt the inexorable , we should seek to accommodate it and ameliorate its sometimes awful consequences . ethnonationalism the wars of tribe and faith return URL globalism vs. ethnonationalism URL	c0sx8n0	worldpolitics

from the comments but on the other side , when you have a group like hamas , that explicity calls for israel 's destruction in its founding charter and does n't recognize israel 's right to exist and continues to use indescrimiate violence whenever it gets the opportunity , there is plenty of blame to go around . ... this is analogous to saying the systemic racism in mid20thcentury america was justified as a way of controlling dangerous '' revolutionary groups like the black panthers . what is missed in this line of thought is that groups like hamas are a natural reaction of human beings forced into a certain position by economic and political pressure . if the palestinians living in their home land just as it is also the home , now anyway , of the israeli jews , were afforded at least some measure of human respect by their oppressors , perhaps violent struggle would not be necessary . it 's funny how most other countries in the world can handle even large exoduses or immigrations , while in this tiny little corner of the mediterranean , two sort of different kinds of oliveskinned , curlyhaired people have managed to create so much vitriolic hatred . i ca n't help but note that some of the worst behaviour from either side has been done in the name of religion or nationalism . it 's cool that there are still people alive today who remember sa apartheid and who are showing solidarity for the palestinians .	c0m0ea1	worldpolitics

the authors of that web site are european , most from the uk . have you ever read european history texts on wwii ? one widely debated , and routinely cited , nonus view on the start of wwii is that the uk and france deliberately did not oppose hitler 's rearming and militarism . the ussr tried to do an alliance with france to prevent germany from taking over czechoslovakia , but france refused . the view states that the reason the uk and france allowed czechoslovakia to be taken over is to push hitler east '' and this was the reason for the west 's appeasement a plan to have hitler attack the ussr . now , few in the us are even aware of this view , let alone the historical data to support such a view . similarly , we in the us are also largely ignorant of operation unthinkable URL '' , the british proposal which the brits took the first steps to implement by keeping complete german units as pows together rather than segregating them the normalcommon practice so they could not easily reform into combat units to the us . fortunately , eisenhower and fdr told churchill to fuck off and that they would n't be so treacherous so churchill cut a deal with stalin instead . and have you read any substantial amount on the creation of west germany and nato in the '40s ? or of stalin and the ussr 's accusations that the uswest broke the wwii agreements to denazify '' west germany ? we 'll ignore the fact that after examining the archives of the ussr , the ussr had no plans to launch an attack on western europe . how do the writers expect to be taken seriously when they type stuff like that ? this is n't the sort of thing that SUBREDDIT . reported . i suppose rather than see things from a different perspective and actually fucking learn something , it 's a lot easier just to have things censored .	c161x82	worldpolitics

by geert wilders yesterday was a beautiful day for freedom of speech in the netherlands . an amsterdam court acquitted me of all charges of hate speech after a legal ordeal that lasted almost two years . the dutch people learned that political debate has not been stifled in their country . they learned they are still allowed to speak critically about islam , and that resistance against islamization is not a crime . i was brought to trial despite being an elected politician and the leader of the thirdlargest party in the dutch parliament . i was not prosecuted for anything i did , but for what i said . my view on islam is that it is not so much a religion as a totalitarian political ideology with religious elements . while there are many moderate muslims , islam 's political ideology is radical and has global ambitions . i expressed these views in newspaper interviews , oped articles , and in my 2008 documentary , fitna . '' i was dragged to court by leftist and islamic organizations that were bent not only on silencing me but on stifling public debate . my accusers claimed that i deliberately insulted '' and incited discrimination and hatred '' against muslims . the dutch penal code states in its articles 137c and 137d that anyone who either publicly , verbally or in writing or image , deliberately expresses himself in any way that incites hatred against a group of people '' or in any way that insults a group of people because of their race , their religion or belief , their hetero or homosexual inclination or their physical , psychological or mental handicap , will be punished . '' i was dragged to court for statements that i made as a politician and which were meant to stimulate public debate in a country where public debate has stagnated for decades . dutch political parties see themselves as guardians of a sterile status quo . i want our problems to be discussed . i believe that politicians have a public trust to further debates about important issues . i firmly believe that every public debate holds the prospect of enlightenment . my views represent those of a growing number of dutch voters , who have flocked to the party for freedom , or pvv . the pvv is the fastestgrowing party in the country , expanding from one seat in the 150seat house of representatives in 2004 , to nine seats in 2006 and 24 seats in 2010. my party 's views , however , are so uncommon in the netherlands that they are considered blasphemous by powerful elites who fear and resent discussion . that 's why i was taken to court , even though the public prosecutor saw no reason to prosecute me . freedom of expression fulfills an essential role in public debate in a democratic society , '' the prosecutors repeatedly said during my trial . that comments are hurtful and offensive for a large number of muslims does not mean that they are punishable . '' the netherlands is one of the few countries in the world where a court can force the public prosecutor to prosecute someone . in january 2009 , three judges of the amsterdam appeals court ordered my prosecution in a politically motivated verdict that focused on the content of the case . they implied that i was guilty . the case was subsequently referred to the amsterdam court of first instance . the judges who acquitted me yesterday already had a peremptory ruling from the appeals court on their desk . they decided , however , to follow the arguments of the public prosecutor , who during the trial had once again reiterated his position and had asked for a full acquittal . though i am obviously relieved by yesterday 's decision , my thoughts go to people such as danish journalist lars hedegaard , austrian human rights activist elisabeth sabaditschwolff and others who have recently been convicted for criticizing islam . they have not been as fortunate . in far too many western countries , it is still impossible to have a debate about the nature of islam . the biggest threat to our democracies is not political debate , nor is it public dissent . as the american judge learned hand once said in a speech that community is already in the process of dissolution . . . where faith in the eventual supremacy of reason has become so timid that we dare not enter our convictions in the open lists to win or lose . '' it has been a tenet in european and american thinking that men are only free when they respect each other 's freedom . if the courts can no longer guarantee this , then surely a community is in the process of dissolution . legislation such as articles 137c and 137d of the dutch penal code disgraces our democratic free societies . on the basis of such legislation , i was prevented from representing my millionandahalf voters in parliament because i had to be in the courtroom for several days , sometimes up to three days per week , during the past year and a half . such legislation should be abolished . it should be abolished in all western countries where it existsand replaced by first amendment clauses . citizens should never allow themselves to be silenced . i have spoken , i speak and i shall continue to speak . mr. wilders is a member of the dutch parliament and the leader of the party for freedom .	c28f46j	worldpolitics

hmmm , if we got into a brief war with china i bet we could figure out a way to ditch all the debt . solution bomb pakistan now . wow ... just ... wow ... so your solution to our debt problem , which is here partly because of war , is to start more war with our biggest trading partner who happens to own one of the biggest shares if not the biggest share of our debt , because bombing pakistan somehow decreases our debt ? your stupidity in unfathomable . i really hope you 're not even close to being serious and you 're just trolling . more seriously , china is all talk when it comes to its military . i think you 're thinking of the us . if you know anything about the present situation in military hardware and tactics , you 'd know that the us is basically a paper tiger . sure , we 've got some neat weapons that sure can deal some damage , but look at their positioning in the far east they 're all within striking distance of chinese ballistic missiles , submarines , and aircraft . they also have ballistic and cruise missiles that can make short work of our surface fleets should they be dumb enough to get close enough to be in their own operational range supposing their subs do n't get them first . it 's not like we have no means to strike them . we do . it 's that they have the ability to strike all of the very vulnerable bases over there and at the least knock out their airfields , rendering them unable to strike against china or even import supplies via airlift . a war with china would be short because they 'd knock out or destroy those bases rather quickly , then we 'd have nothing to attack them with , except maybe a few b2 's , but that 's not going to do much . aggression on their part would ruin their rise because the international community would get anxious . perhaps , but it would also turn the balance of power in the world in their favor , which would help them rise even faster because the question of whether they can deal with the us would be answered . besides that general point , specifically i do n't really believe china would stick its neck out too far for pakistan what good does pakistan do them compared with what they get from the united states ? there 's a plethora of reasons china would gain from having pakistan as such a close ally . they 'd have them for positioning against india , which is their primary concern . they 'd stop the us from pushing into pakistan which would be very bad for china because that would allow india more power . they would have access to ports in the indian ocean , which would be the perfect staging area for their new aircraft carrier . and they would build their support bloc up even more adding a nuclear power to their group of friends would be very handy , especially if india and pakistan end up getting a permanent un seat in the future , which is possible . but the most obvious thing , and the trigger for their actions , is that it fucks up america 's plans in central asia .	c1v2jvb	worldpolitics

well , with some of the radical islamists , i can see how they might justifiably feel oppressed in some instances . but american rightwingers ? c'mon ! they 're not oppressed . far from it , they 're in a dominant position in american society . they just buy all the propaganda from glenn beck , rush limbaugh , etc , that they 're being somehow oppressed '' , when really they 're a lot more influential in america than the progressives , for instance . they think dems are far left '' , when really if you go to most western countries , i think you 'd find that the political spectrum in the us is more skewed to the right than in most other places . the democrats are more like our conservatives here in canada , for instance . i would n't automatically buy the idea that people are oppressed '' just because they whine and bitch about being oppressed '' .	c1dwf4v	worldpolitics

thanks , that link provides a very interesting counterpoint . the two sides disagree so much that it seems like a little investigative journalism would crack the story wide open . somebody is lying through their teeth . unfortunately , journalists are the same quality as tomatoes in america ... statements like this are just incompatible the fact in reality is that florida tomato industry is probably without a doubt the most progressive , socially accountable produce industry in the entire country . vs. slavery is what is happening . there is no way to gloss it . you ca n't say slaverylike . '' you ca n't say nearslavery . '' human trafficking '' does n't even do it credit . here are some things that are in court records it 's all been proven . i hope this does get investigated further , by real humans , not by fake media or government stooges . also , reggie brown is a fullofshit corporate stooge when he says stuff like this we produce a product in florida that is a high quality , safe , wholesome tomato that is capable of withstanding the rigors of the marketplace , that provides america with a product for six or seven months out of the year sometimes longer in areas of the country where they would otherwise be totally devoid of tomatoes . totally devoid of tomatoes ?

i 'm not israeli actually . out of what has happened in contemporary times , i have just never seen something more insane than what goes on revolving israel . i 'm not calling you an antisemite . i tried to but probably should 've made further clear that you did n't apply to my generalizations . as a matter of fact , i do n't really know what your thoughts are really to begin with i mainly tried to clarify my first comment with my response to you . what 's funny about the last thing you said is that you differentiate jewish and israeli where one is a religion and the other is a nationality . jewish , if you think about it and know your stuff , is also a nationality . jewish people are n't necessarily followers of the jewish faith , unlike christians or muslims are by definition . those are people characterized by religion . jewish '' on the other hand is not significant of that . with that in context , maybe what i said will make more sense . everybody has radically different misconceptions about jews as a people and israel as a country for the most part negative . this is the first and last time i commented because through such means , it is a pointless effortbattle . it 's for all the reasons i mentioned . sorry i didn'tcould n't really tell you more . i can , just , it 'll fuel responses to things i do n't want which was the reason that my original comment was contained within what it was . the remarks were only directed at those in a position fully against israel unless for really person reasons , even though that 'll just make you biased . yes , israel does n't do everything right as all countries do n't because of decisions by the government but that 's mainly in regarding itself not really any of the fucked up shit that it 's always portrayed as beingcommencing in .	c215ahj	worldpolitics

i wish it were that simple . you ca n't solely attribute all of a nation 's decisions to the figure you see on television every day . in fact , one of the reasons figureheads exist is to deflect attention away from the deeper , factional machinery at work . ahmadinejad 's presidential term marked a move by new conservative players in the political arena to push out the establishments conservatives , the clergy . this project was jeopardized by the reformists who were politically crippled after rafsanjani 's failure to reform the republic during his presidency during the election fraud scandal when they tried to seize hold of popular unrest and force the principalist '' factions to make concessions . however , the reformists were too limited in their scope , and lacked the ambition to challenge the legitimacy of the islamic republic itself , and set any hope of democratization even further backwards by their misguided attempts . if you look at mousavi the green movement 's leader you 'll find that he shares the same roots as the people he opposed now , do you seriously expect ahmadinjad to throw his hands up in the air and say , oh no , you caught me cheating ! now let me discard the careful plans of my entire faction and concede defeat '' ? he simply does n't have that freedom . once you 're in the mob '' , you ca n't leave . in terms of stability and addressing the clergy , if i had to choose between disorganized populist chaos , or a well organized , well funded insitution the irgc represented by ahmadinejad , i would have to choose the latter even though they are not democratic in nature . if you disagree , may i point you to the aftermath of what happened the last time there was a popular revolution in the country . revolutions often severely hurt a country 's sovereignty and ability to protect its interests in the region . outside of iran , if you think the chapter on egypt , tunisia , libya , etc . is closed with the people victorious and impervious to foreign influence , i suggest you reconsider . even in the case of the ruthless bastard bashar alassad , while he may be killing with impunity to maintain power , him and his faction are also tied to interests holding back the majority from ethnically cleansing 15 of the population . i wish things were as simple as good and evil , but it 's naive to think that they are .	c2m9tmq	worldpolitics

you know what , i 'd be okay with homeless people volunteering for this environment , because the prison requires that the prisoners work and learn a trade , because drugs and alcohol are not allowed , and because the prisoners receive counseling . a lot of people who are homeless are in an ugly cycle , with mental illness , substance abuse issues , and not knowing a tradehaving a way of getting a job being what keeps them on the street . ultimately , my bet is that housing these sorts of people in a place where they can work to earn their keep , where they can get help and the drug abuse problem can be addressed would actually cost less than dealing with the various problems associated with having them on the street . i also suspect that as they put their lives back together and had time to heal , a lot of people who went in intending never to leave again would find themselves feeling ready to face the world again where , instead of being a drain on society 's resources , they would be able to contribute . i suspect it would be an 'everyone wins ' scenario .	c1t9g6p	worldpolitics

fucking hell i 'm out of the loop , i had n't even heard that this was actually going through . badscotsman edit thought i 'd add something constructive . i highly doubt this will make much of a difference . you 'll get the wankers who vote labour to piss off their rich parents , or worse they 'll vote for the ssp which is pissing your vote away . conversely you 'll get kids voting conservative because they grew up that way and labour as well . lastly you 'll get people voting snp because they 're 16 and want to feel like rebels . i was prosnp at that age , and i was pretty far left as well . i 'm entering my early 20 's properly now and i could n't be more centrist . in a way i think it 's a bit of a waste of time because the vast majority of 16 year olds are arrogant , or just plain ignorant as is a young person 's want because ... you just do n't know at that age that you do n't know a lot . i may have had a pretty large interest in politics at that age but i knew a lot less than i do now ... and i was a lot less cynical too . tell a lie , i was cynical as fuck then but went through that one year period of idealism when it was election year on my 18th birthday and then realised my younger self was right to be cynical when i saw the liberal democrats turn their back on their voters , and all the political parties protect their friends in the financial sector after continuing practices so corrupt i 'm amazed we did n't rise as one and slay them . i 'll still say 16 year olds should definitely be given a voice in scottish politics because at that age here you can leave school , get a job which is unfortunately way under minimum wage on fulltime , frankly if you 're working fulltime as an apprentice tradesman and you 're good at what you do , you should get paid the same as an 18 year old , you can legally get married , rent a flat and so on . i 'm pretty sure you can even pay tax , so really you have every right to have a voice in how our country is run . with that said the next 4 years alone will give you a boatload of life experience that enable you to make better choices and understand the world so much better . there 's a real danger people will vote on issues they do n't truly understand , but what would be different there ?	c2lnzti	worldpolitics

it 's not just muslims that can be sectarian bigots ... recently , during a meeting of the assembly of the reunion of aid agencies for the oriental churches roaco , a number of outspoken christian figures were criticised for the views they 've been expressing about the free syrian army and situation in syria by archbishop mario zenari , apostolic nuncio to damascus . he began by describing events in syria as a genuine popular uprising and that the majority of opposition members were not radical and not antichristian . he said there was no systematic persecution of christians , and that christians had been killed alongside alawites and sunnis in bombings and skirmishes , but not because of their religious beliefs . he added that to his knowledge no christian church has been attacked as part of sectarian violence .

i am simply stating the facts . zionism is a popular enemy in the middle east . is this justified ? yes it entirely , understandable , but it is also commonly exploited by middle eastern governments to further their own ends , when the reality , they are doing nothing to solve the problem . the text you quoted included grammatical errors and poor word choice on my part , which ended up conveying the wrong message . it has been fixed on my word document , thanks for bringing this to my attention . the revised section reads however what s important to note is that while the threat of israel to iranian interests is very real , the threat is heavily exacerbated by the iranian government . zionism is a very popular enemy throughout the muslim world , and iranian ayatollahs know as well as al assad in syria , and ghadafi in libya did that opposing zionist interests is a good way to hold on to power . obviously israel is not thrilled by the prospect of a country with a sphere of influence that includes syria for now and lebanon , both of which border israel , as well as the potential for nuclear capability , which relies heavily on antiisraeli rhetoric to protect its hold on power . this is why israel is uniquely concerned about iran right now , because unlike the myriad other countries that would like to destroy it , iran might actually try something . also , like i 've said , i have n't even gotten to israel 's role in creating conflict in the region , which i expect will take up a page or two . i 'm not trying to support any agenda here , this is my analysis of the facts .	c5lrigg	worldpolitics

everyday i 'm leaning more towards they are actually trying to force us into a preemptive strike '' . why , i do n't know . if that 's what they 're up to , and there 's really no way to say one way or the other , then the reason for that approach would be to initiate a war in a defensive way , so that they would feel justified launching their all out war . i doubt they would feel to justified if they just outright launched an all out attack , or if they first started with a low level attack . so , if they 're trying to pick a fight , they 're going about it the proper '' way , so to speak . i would say that their machinations are a lot more complicated , especially more so than you often read in the news . but if this keeps going , at some point s korea and the us are going to have to consider striking first to avoid mass causalities on the south side of the border . i do n't think the south is ever going to opt for a preemptive strike , despite what they say , because that will be them choosing to sacrifice hundreds of thousands , maybe millions of people on their side as well as immeasurable damage done to their country physically and economically . the us is n't going to preempt for the same reason . the north , however , might feel at some point that it has no choice but to preempt if it feels the southus are going to and with their recent behavior eliciting such strong counterprovocations , they could very well believe that , or they could choose to do it if they feel they 're at the end of their politicaleconomicsocial rope at home with the failure of this round of provocations and the inexperience of their leader , they may believe that as well . north korea is completely unpredictable right now , so just ignore anyone who tells you with certainty what will or will not happen . this is n't history repeating itself , it 's all new and uncharted territory .	c96z9u4	worldpolitics

great article that documents the foremost role by the israel lobbydiaspora zionism in the syria war push . it dispels a lot of myths and redherrings , often advanced on the left , about how capitalism or the militaryindustrial complex or oil interests or u.s. nationalist and geopolitical interests are really to blame , and the poor israel lobbyzionist jewry is merely being scapegoated . in the case of syria , and in the case of iraq and probably most of the other u.s. mideast interventions '' since 911 it 's now clear that the israel lobbyzionist jewry are the driving force , with other interests playing much smaller roles , or no role at all . remember , counterpunch , where this article was published , comes from a leftwing perspective . true , it 's long been antizionist , but it 's also always been eager to nail capitalism to the wall , as well . i think many on the left are finally realizing that zionism neofascism , that zionist jewry , particularly diaspora zionists , have long been playing a twofaced game of passing themselves off as progressives '' and liberals , '' yet always profiting handsomely from their selfserving racist racket and from their wealthy neoliberalism , URL and discriminating against those on the left inclined to identify zionism as the racist and fascist formulation it truly is . the whole antisemitism '' and jewish victim '' propaganda complex , which is also part of the zionist ideology and modusoperandi , is being seen through , as well . the clock is finally running out on the whole charade , and on those who have been playing it out , including so much of the corrupt zionistpartisan political class in the beltway . and really , what better trojan horse for neofascism than to be smuggled in through the group that was supposedly fascism 's greatest victims . yet zionism has always been fascism , only on a smaller scale than european fascism , but as we 've seen with both the neocon right and the neolb left signing on to the zionist brand of fascism , it 's not so small anymore , and may be even more dangerous , given its wolf in sheep 's clothing '' abilities ... which have successfully fooled even a lot of jews .	cc7rhgy	worldpolitics
i think blumenthal makes a great case that there 's so much about zionism that is essentially fascist . supporting fascist israel makes a bit of ideological sense for neocons and neoliberals , but it never did make much ideological sense for lefties unless one views marxism as a trojan horse for zionism which a lot of jewish lefties in the alterman vein clearly do , and with good historical justification URL . yet today , the writing is on the wall ... dedicated zionist jews are increasingly unwelcome on the left . i 'm sure the neocon right will take them in , which scares the neolib dnc to death , but i 'm not really sure why because the neolibs and neocons are essentially the same animal . in fact , other than in name , the elites of the gop and the democratic party have essentially merged around the issue of zionism . hence , what america really needs is a truly antizionist party , because nearly everyone except the zionists and their accomplices at this point are essentially going unrepresented as far as their long term individual , group and national interests go ... all because the elect '' elites have put themselves and the chosen '' first . big surprise there , huh ?	ccyqbp2	worldpolitics

since no one 's actually answering your question ... israel and its allies voted against it because then it would have to let international weapons inspectors into all of its nuclear facilities and they would see the nuclear weapons that israel claims to not have . the countries that voted against this resolution want israel to keep its nuclear weapons and continue to be the most militarily powerful state in the middle east for a whole bunch of reasons . if israel joined the npt and admitted to having nuclear weapons than there would be no way for them to keep them without becoming the sort of international pariah that north korea and iran have become . also if it turned out they did n't have nuclear weapons than now everyone would know and not be nearly as intimidated by them . it 's best for israeli security for all their neighbors to think that they have nuclear weapons regardless of whether it 's true .	ccdwud9	worldpolitics

interesting how all of these zionists work in rough unison , and use their infiltration of mass media to hammer away at the same themes . also take note of their constant invocation of wwii , yet another threadbare zionist modus operandi while israel could still attack iran s nuclear sites on its own , i ts ability to do so is already being narrowed considerably by the diplomatic thaw between iran and the united states , abrams wrote in foreign affairs magazine . it is one thing to bomb iran when it appears hopelessly recalcitrant and isolated and quite another to bomb it when much of the world especially the united states is optimistic about the prospects of talks. abrams assessment was widely shared among his ideological comrades who believe israel will be the big loser if hopes for dtente between washington and tehran gather steam after next week s meeting in geneva between iran and the p51 the united states , britain , france , russia and china plus germany . the weekly standard , a neoconservative publication , described israel s position as standing alone , the title of its lead editorial at week s end , although its authors , editorinchief william kristol and the director of the jewish institute for national security affairs jinsa , michael makovsky , took a far more defiant tone than abrams . they urged netanyahu to follow through on his latest threats to attack iran s nuclear facilities with or without u.s. approval . no one likes the truthtelling skunk at the appeasement party , they wrote , asserting that president barack obama s softheaded , even desperate , desire for some sort of nuclear deal , any deal with iran comprised the kind of western failure of nerve and a collapse of will that british prime minister winston churchill decried with the rise of nazi germany in the 1930s . similarly , the wall street journal s chief foreign affairs columnist , bret stephens , complained bitterly about the situation confronting israel in the wake of rouhani s u.n. tour de force the previous week . their tactics and predictability have become almost laughable .	ccok1kz	worldpolitics

so you 're saying that since some people think that 's what corruption means , it 's definitely so . what you described was bad , and it 's a problem with israel but it 's not corruption . corruption , basically , is when politicians screw over their own citizens for personal gain . that is the definition of political corruption per wikipedia URL political corruption is the use of power by government officials for illegitimate private gain . the dictionary definition is wider , e.g . from the thefreedictionary URL corruption krpn 1. the act of corrupting or state of being corrupt 2. moral perversion depravity 3. dishonesty , esp bribery i should add that the israeli political system is extremely corrupt , as the fact that many leading politicians e.g . lieberman , arik sharon , and ehud ulmert , to name three of the more prominent ones were all investigated and indicted for corruption per your definition . not to mention many many others like the recently indicted mayor of batyam shlomo lachiani . the fundamental point that bears tireless repetition is that israel has no rule of law , since it 's judiciary habitually discriminates between people based on their ethnicity and thus is inherently corrupt per the wider definition . the fact that the conviction rate in the opt is 99 , that very few crimes against palestinians in the opt ever result in indictments is further proof . the fact that these gangsters dress in suits , have bred nobel and turing laureates and some can speak fluent legalese changes nothing . it is time for them to be called out for what they are thieves , in a state based on theft , running an extortionist ring that is holding the world to ransom and corrupting every state they are allowed to , while brutalising anything they touch and getting away with murder literally and daily . in a sense they are even more dangerous than the more obvious examples you mention , since they are able to corrupt the legal and political systems of other countries through their lobbys .	c9u96hh	worldpolitics
i have to say that this is a misleading title and the author of this short article used selective hearing to support his antiisrael agenda . sodastream is actually headquartered in tel aviv URL and owns a factory in mishor adumim . sodastream recently 2011 decided not to expand the factory at mishor adumim , but rather to build one inside the green line URL . the construction is already underway , as decided by the board of directors . sodastream has tons of subsidiaries URL around the world and does n't just manufacture their product in israel , they also manufacture their product in germany , sweden , new zealand , australia , south africa , netherlands and china . having a factory in the west bank provides local palestinians jobs , 160 palestinian families to be exact , who depend on it for employment . those 160 palestinians receive full social and health services in accordance with , and exceeding , israeli law , including pension contributions and insurance . labor law in israel requires an employer to pay wages and contributions 4 times higher than those required by the palestinian authority . facts please , not propaganda .	c892glm	worldpolitics

here 's the article preview photo michael reynoldsepa the white house has moved to dampen controversy over the role of the director of national intelligence james clapper in a panel reviewing nsa surveillance , insisting that he would neither lead it nor choose the members . the apparent involvement of clapper , who has admitted lying to congress over nsa surveillance of us citizens , provoked a backlash , with critics accusing the president of putting a fox in charge of the hen house . republican congressman justin amash , who led a revolt that narrowly failed in its effort to cut nsa funding , tweeted pres obama believes man who lied to public in congressional hearing about nsa should lead nsa review process meant to build public trust '' . clapper apologised last month for misleading a senate hearing by denying that the nsa collects information about millions of americans . in response to leaks by former nsa contractor edward snowden , obama announced at a press conference on friday that an independent panel of outsiders would be set up to investigate concerns about the scale of nsa surveillance . powered by textteaser api URL .	cbncoq5	worldpolitics

what we need to do is find a middle path . you are absolutely right that most people do n't have the timeability to learn all the in 's and out 's of every bill presented in the house and senate , however ... why could n't we find a middle ground where we did just a few little changes 1. version control it 's been around since the 70 's for computer programming , it would n't be hard to implement to force representatives and senators to admit which parts of each bill they wrote it would also make it obvious when a corporate lackey was writing in their stead , as it will all be electronically noted for public consumption. . 2. a wiki for bills it should be required that the bills are made publicly available immediately upon being presented to the house or senate , and in a format which allows the citizens of the country to discuss and in some cases , edit the bill 's in question . if wikipedia can become the worlds biggest repository of information through volunteerism , i suspect we could find enough intelligent volunteers on both sides of the political aisle to make this work . with this , not everybody has to educate themselves , only those who want to or already have . 3. citizen ratification bills can only be voted on after being ratified by a majority vote of the public . this part would be trickier to implement , and while it would help a lot , might be the part i 'd have to leave out realistically . 4 . 6 year term limits , no reelections the founding fathers of this country felt that working in government was supposed to be a public service . you were supposed to go in , do your work , and then go back to working in the private sector when your term was done . obviously , that is not how it currently works . i mean , just these four things right here could cut a load of living crap out of our political system and once again start making voters feel like their ideals and opinions actually count for something . i personally suggest we push for changes like this on a state level , through voter initiatives , and when we can show its effective on a state level , start pushing for federal changes of the same stripes .	cdei1lg	worldpolitics

the fight against communism '' is another prime example of propaganda that still massively impacts the us political landscape . between the 1950s until the fall of the berlin wall 1990 40 years , the us and its allies pushed a major propaganda campaign of propaganda which equated communism socialism evil which was then often extended so that socialism left wing liberalism evil . hence , at any stage in us political discussion , as soon as any comment is made which is slightly left wing , the opposition screams socialism '' and rational debate dies immediately . which is basically why the us currently has 2 right wing political parties , with the republicans on the political far right , and the democrats politically centerright . any left wing or liberal political opinions tend to come from groups like the greens , who are in such a minority to be powerless . hence , political debate only ever really occurs in a right wing echo chamber , with anything left wing abused out of existence . this is the reality and power of 2 generations of govt and private propaganda derailing any real democratic or political discussion .	c82lrlt	worldpolitics

yes , absolutely us press is an obedient parrot of propaganda . the us military and executive have both stated emphatically that if they media outlets , broadcasters , etc do not cooperate they will not get the interviews , briefings , press releases , data or access to anyone so instead of investigating they parrot the propaganda they are fed . yes that is good for business , but that does not remove the fact they are parroting official propaganda . i and many others have spent years as part of postgrad research on the effect of this , which really started to have it 's presence felt with embedded journalism which was all about the very clearly stated media war '' being waged by the pentagon anyone who was not part of this embedded in other words strictly controlled propaganda could not have their safety safe guarded the us promptly attacked and bombed many nonembedded news organisations inside iraq including al jazeera and independent journalists in the palestine hotel in baghdad . they also set up dozens of paid propagandist media outlets in tv , print and radio which now operate throughout the middle east . the primary weapon at the us military disposal has been for some time as historically always been the case disinformation and the war on truth the intel communities involvement with outlets like twitter , facebook etc are well and truly documented and known traditional media propaganda has been going on for decades . every single news outlet in the united states was carrying and paying for us military generals as their war time specialists it does not get any more propaganda than the military directly speaking on national television . since the early 2000 there has been almost no independent news investigation in the united states on any major news network none almost everything is directed on brief , while the vast majority of news is sourced from central news outlets , wire services etc , with images and footage prepackaged while journalists are almost entirely dependant on briefings from official us sources i doubt that a single us journalist from a major private network has been inside south america for investigative journalism in almost a decade . people now days , specifically anyone under the age of 40 would have absolutely no recollection of what independent investigative news reporting is the whole notion is entirely dead and buried the only news which people receive on television now is almost totally compliant with official dogma ... us media is easily the most propagandized media from offiicial sources of any modern civilised nation east or west . . .	c86nvl4	worldpolitics

URL that is pure speculation . i disagree . here 's an excerpt from some coverage of the bug from the guardian URL when did the bug appear ? in ios 6.0 , which went public in september 2012 . it s not yet clear precisely when the error appeared in mac osx , but it s likely to be at the same time , since the mobile and desktop oss use common code trees . the bug wasn t there in the final version of ios 5 , 5.1.1 , released in may 2012. now let us take a look at the nsa prism roadmap , URL which was leaked by snowden . you will see that apple was added to their list of nsa prism providers on october 2012 . according to google , ios 6 rolled out on september 19 , 2012. with the new iphone 5 shipping on september 22nd ... the likelihood of apple being listed as a prism provider right after the release of ios6 with newly flawed code should be a huge red flag ... you may want to pass it off as a coincidence but we 're talking about an agency which manipulated security juggernaut rsa to adopt backdoored crypto which was slower than all the other proven algorithms and they made it the default option in their security suite ... apple wo n't obviously admit what they did but anyone looking at the facts will be able to make the clear connection .	cgpg6u5	worldpolitics

nice try , however ... the first picture shows the land where jews lived after they legally bought land because ottoman empire sold it to them in the region while it was under the ottoman rule . later ottoman empire wanted to pull off a genocide , similar to the one they did to armenians , to the jews as they perceived they bought too much land and turks in the region perceived those jewish towns as threat , ironically . luckily for both turks and jews , the genocide process did n't happen because ww1 started . the difference between the second and third picture is simple , on day1 of existence of israel , all its ' neighbours attacked , but israel won the war . as punishment for the aggressors it took some of their land . then again in 1967 another war broke out , which israel had won again and even occupied the whole sinai peninsula . israel could have punished the alliance for numbers of terrorist attacks before the war , but it did n't . israel even left sinai to egypt and offered them to take gaza in , which they rejected . instead , the arabian states responded by attacking israel several years later during a holiday . the difference between the third and the fourth picture is even simpler , as it 's not history , it 's exactly what is happening at the moment . after the arabian states realized they will never win a war against israel , they started supporting terrorist organizations , which started aiming at israeli citizens while using the arabian people in the region as human shields when israel retaliated . at about the same time the term 'palestinian nation ' was started to be used to define the arabs of the region , which were actually just ancestors of arabs that lived under a turkic state the ottoman empire . to stop the never ending terrorist attacks israel has only one choice remove the hamas ' and fatah ' control over the territories they still hold . once the two parties whose ideology prevents anything short of extermination of the whole israel state fatah and hamas have been destroyed , then the sides can talk , instead of posting propaganda posters without any context like this one .	cj1s6vi	worldpolitics

fascinating that this article is being run in marketwatch , which is owned and run by murdoch 's news corp and the wall street journal . it looks like capitalism has finally realized that it has a fairly serious mentalmentality problem . moneyworship is indeed a sickness . but capitalism 's problems are about more than just moneyworship . without being fully aware of the shift , americans have drifted from having a market economy to becoming a market society ... where almost everything is up for sale ... a way of life where market values seep into almost every sphere of life and sometimes crowd out or corrode important values , nonmarket values. ... in one generation , market ideology consumed america s collective spirit the years leading up to the financial crisis of 2008 were a heady time of market faith and deregulation an era of market triumphalism , says sandel . the era began in the early 1980s , when ronald reagan and margaret thatcher proclaimed their conviction that markets , not government , held the key to prosperity and freedom. the problem is that big government has a serious mentalmentality problem , as well ... it 's called totalitarianism and government profiteering via extraction of wealth from the average citizens . in fact , the government bailouts of banks and corporations crony capitalism are part and parcel of big government , and a lot of these billionaire oligarchs plenty of the jewish ones in particular have made their billions by way of their connections to central government andor insider status with the jewishdominated URL federal reserve and the wall street casinos it underwrites . a lot of the moral and ethical lapses of capitalism can be traced to racketeering jews , as well , who have no bottom line in terms of how they go about exploiting the goyim '' to line their own pockets , because the jewish moral and ethical system URL has no regard for the interests of nonjews , and in fact looks upon the erosion of gentile values , ethics and morality as good for the jews because it undermines the competition and allows the zionist jews to set themselves up as the authorities via their rackets . jewishdominated msm URL has played a crucial role in devastating american morals , ethics and values as well . so free enterprise not crony capitalismgovernment profiteering , which is the system the u.s. now operates under thanks to zionist infiltration , including by zionist fox news and murdoch checked and balanced by the grecochristian moral and ethical system that governed western civilization prior to zionist infiltration , can , has , does and will work again so long as sleazy , corrupt and badwill elements revolving from left to right around diaspora zionist jewry which putrefies everything it touches into a tribalserving racket are brought to heel via migration to israel . for the jewish zionists , who are are at the crux of the problem as opposed to assimilating jews more likely to see themselves as in the west for the long haul , thus less likely to putrefy israel is their foremost loyalty anyway , so their departure could be a winwin for everyone .	clk8ou8	worldpolitics

yes , however that has nothing to do with the term antisemite '' or antisemetic .

nightwatchman state . at its heart , a nightwatchman state is weakly regulated and designed to protect property , so it is very much a capitalist state , or will soon turn into one . strong property ownership and weak regulation leads to accumulations of capital , which in turn results in a ruling class that can subvert whatever state apparatus is already present . the only reason the west has been able to stick around for a century was the world wars , which dismantled some concentrations of wealth , and the separation of powers , which made it more difficult for wealth and power to assert control over democracy . regulated communism i do n't know why you keep bringing communism into the conversation , because nobody here is advocating it . in my opinion , a successful state requires regulation to prevent accumulations of power which will end up subverting the state strong human rights to maintain justice strong rights to free speech to allow for efficient markets and to prevent the buildup of corruption regulation to protect the environment to prevent collapse from resource depletion and pollution welfare to protect the members of society , such as the disabled , elderly and feeble , who are not capable of looking after themselves i 've yet to see a fully unregulated capitalist state , victorian england had many of these aspects . how exactly should a capitalist '' make money ? sit around waiting for his parents to die ? in very privileged families , children are wealthy by the time they reach adulthood . given that investment produces the fastest growth in wealth , those with wealth to invest will become wealthier more quickly than others . this fact makes the economy inherently unstable , and can only be mitigated through regulation and taxation . i 'm saying a country that currently functions as a welfare state would make a better society over time if it would be a nightwatchman state . i believe your position is simplistic and would only lead to a large class of poor starving people and dictatorship from a wealthy class .	cn2qp15	worldpolitics

jews believe that israel is the holy land given to them by gd and abandoned for four thousand years , let 's not ignore that part ! or do we just ignore the whole diaspora because it does n't fit the narrative ? and who gives a fuck what religious beliefs say ? i do n't care what the torah says , the torah does not change reality nor negate the existence and preexistence of palestine . i will care what religious scholars say about god when god himself comes down from heaven and confirms it . otherwise you just have an insane person ranting about the voices in their head that they choose to attribute to god . i 'm jewish , so i know this access to knowledge is not mediated by religious belief , i do n't give a fuck what you are , except that you 're a liar . historically , jews lived in palestine . and yet palestine was not jewish '' . i 'm talking specifically about jews you and you alone , stop conflating israel with judaism , it 's a lie and you know it .	cfixala	worldpolitics

the crusades had nothing to do with a militant fixation on the old testament . unfortunately we do n't have a a good transcript of pope urban ii 's proclamation , and the unofficial ones that have popped up contradict each other . what we do know is that pope urban called for the first crusade in response to the byzantine emperor 's call for aid against the seljuk turks . from the letters we have of pope urban ii he did n't really justify the crusades with the old testament but said that they needed to happen in order to liberate eastern churches and gave jerusalem as an end goal .	cjgmb2o	worldpolitics

will hamas not bring in weapons into gaza to attack israel with ? we do n't know , do we ? but given the size of israel 's massive armed forces and its hundreds of nuclear weapons , if hamas were to bring in weapons to attack israel , they would have to have one helluva lot of money and bring in one helluva lot of weapons . that is highly unlikely to happen . if hamas ' stated goal in its charter is to destory israel ... let 's ignore the decades of israeli ethnic cleansing and jewishonly settlements '' on the illegally occupied west bank . consider 3 points the israeli prime minister is a member of a political party which has a plank in its party platform vowing to never allow a palestinian state to be formed and to never give up any of the biblical lands of ancient israel . the largest caucus in the israeli parliament today is a political caucus with identical positions vowing not to allow a palestinian state to be formed and to never give up any of the biblical lands of ancient israel . the israeli government refuses to define israel 's international borders . actions speak louder than words . in a decades old document , the radical founders of hamas did indeed write about destroying israel . today 's hamas leaders have a very different position , and hamas ' actions today are defensive in trying to stop israeli apartheid , ethnic cleansing and to establish the state of palestine . those actions do not support the statement in that decades old hamas charter written by people who are not in charge of hamas today . israel 's actions today are in complete agreement with the 3 positions i stated about netanyahu 's party and the israeli parliament 's largest caucus .	cjxqmwf	worldpolitics

the reason that leaders of organized jewry spend so much time conflating israel , zionism and the jews is because they know they are all the same entity with the same jewish nation values . they also know that those racist zionist tribal values are totally inconsistent and incompatible with western universal and constitutional values , and so the jews must be constantly assembled and united under the banner of anti antisemitism '' if the leaders of zionism and their plutocrat gentile accomplices are going to successfully impose their institutionally bigoted oligarchical , 1 serving , judeosupremacist will upon the masses . oppose zionism , the oligarchs and the plutocracy ? you 're an antiwestern , antisemitic , leftwing radical or an antiwestern , antisemitic , rightwing nazi . never mind that organized jewry has opposed the evolution of the west into its current universal form from the ancient greeks and romans through christendom through the enlightenment as antijewish '' every step of the way URL never mind that tribal racist zionist values are totally hostile and contrary to western universal values the jews and their accomplices have anointed chosen '' jewry all that is good , '' so anyone opposed to them must be all that is bad . '' so one should be able to see by now why the zionists need a totalitarian , big brother police state to enforce this totally illogical , totally insane , upside down state of affairs where zionism is western , war is peace , freedom is slavery , and ignorance is strength . it 's because only when a zionist big brother gets to define reality '' is the imposition of racist and messianic judeosupremacism as an acceptable and desirable state of affairs possible .	cof7y30	worldpolitics

it 's not just me there are loads of people who have researched ukraine and russia and are very knowledgeable they just never get invited onto mainstream tv news or to write articles in mainstream papers . stephen cohen american scholar of russian studies . stephen cohen writes tor URL and has regularly appeared on URL on the importance of ukraine to moscow ukraine is a region absolutely essential in moscow s view to its national security and even to its civilization on the usnato military encirclement of russia the ongoing usnato encirclement of russia with bases , as well as land and seabased missile defense , only increases this possibility of the use of nuclear weapons every american president and congress has treated postsoviet russia as a defeated nation with inferior legitimate rights at home and abroad . this triumphalist , winnertakeall approach has been spearheaded by the expansion of natoaccompanied by nonreciprocal negotiations and now missile defenseinto russia s traditional zones of national security , while in reality excluding it from europe s security system. on the vilification of vladimir putin indeed , highly charged suspicions , resentments , misconceptions and misinformation both in washington and moscow may make such mutual restraints even more difficult . the same is true of the surreal demonization of russia s leader , vladimir putina kind of personal vilification without any real precedent in the past on the failure of american political discourse we do have access to important alternative media , but they are not considered authoritative , or even essential , inside the beltway . in my long lifetime , i do not recall such a failure of american democratic discourse in such a time of crisis. moscow s view of the ukrainian crisis is almost entirely missing in mainstream coverage . on who is to blame for sparking the crisis in ukraine in short , it was not putin s alleged aggression that initiated today s crisis but instead a kind of velvet aggression by brussels and washington to bring all of ukraine into the west , including in the fine print into nato. washington and brussels endorsed the coup , and have supported the outcome ever since . everything that followed , from russia s annexation of crimea and the spread of rebellion in southeastern ukraine to the civil war and kiev s antiterrorist operation , was triggered by the february coup . putin s actions have been mostly reactive. on who is responsible for escalating the crisis the underlying causes of the crisis are ukraine s own internal divisions , not primarily putin s actions . the primary factor escalating the crisis since may has been kiev s antiterrorist military campaign against its own citizens , now mainly in the donbass cities of luhansk and donetsk . putin influences and no doubt aids the donbass selfdefenders. considering the pressure on him in moscow , he is likely to continue to do so , perhaps even more , but he does not control them . if kiev s assault ends , putin probably can compel the rebels to negotiate . but only the obama administration can compel kiev to stop , and it has not done so. patrick l. smith columnist for salon on the us s ultimate goal in russia there can be no cold war ii because the cold war as we knew it never ended . nato s eastward creep , georgia in 2008 , ukraine now , the merciless , reckless sanctionsall that has changed since 1991 are tactics , not strategy . to put this precisely , washington s intent is not to destroy russia it is to destroy what we may as well call putin s russia. the implications here should be evident . this is regime change on the grandest scale . on the western superiority complex in my read , the war we have entered upon brings into sharp focus the 21st century s single most vital zone of conflict . this is the nonwest s historically unprecedented insistence that it is the equal of the west , that its values are as valid as the west s , that the world is multiple now and that to become modern no longer means to become western. it is this the american elite thinks is worth a war . it is putin s sin that he fights this war . bitter truth no . 2 in this context we must hope he wins it , for the world will be far better off when america s compulsion to dominate it is defeated. on the failure of the american press it has proven impossible to write about foreign affairs this year without becoming something of a media critic . the logic here should be evident . few would argue that the american press has performed well on the foreign side since the earliest days of the cold war . but the deterioration of overseas coverage is something else that has accelerated markedly this year. on the purposeful misreading of putin read the transcript of vladimir putin s press conference last week , an annual affair with none of the phony staging and screened questions american leaders require . it is here . we are protecting our independence , our sovereignty and our right to exist , the russian leader said among much else . think about this . it is not the remark of a man who plans to go anywhere soon . think about it again while looking back on the year now ending . then ask how did it come to this ? why would a russian leader be moved to say this ? the american press did all it could to caricature putin s exchange with journalists . my favorite among the strivers was businessweek , for which magazine , i suppose we have to call it , putin s press conference was surreal , extremely long and very weird. read the piece here . the juvenile vocabulary is for a purpose . surreal , weird press conferences do not have to be considered , to say nothing of understood . the above questions do not have to be asked . asking them would be a very bad thing . so would understanding . on a postwestern multipolar world one could say it is not the west s world any longer , and i called it postwestern in a book several years ago . this is not quite so . it is ours , but only to the extent that it is destined to be everybody s , if i read history rightly . as an american , my biggest regret on this score apart from all the suffering caused in our names is that my country seems bent on doing almost everything it can to lose out on a great deal of what would be its share in the arriving era this in the name of prolonging a time that is no longer. pat buchanan former us presidential candidate , commentator and author on the west s part in sparking the crisis what is happening in ukraine is a tragedy and a disaster . and we are in part responsible , having egged on the maidan coup that overthrew the elected prorussian government. on the us arming ukraine america has never had a vital interest in crimea or the donbass worth risking a military clash with russia . and we do not have the military ability to intervene and drive out the russian army , unless we are prepared for a larger war and the potential devastation of the ukraine . but a greater disaster looms if we get ourselves embroiled in ukraine s civil war . we would face , first , the near certainty of defeat for our allies , if not ourselves . second , we would push moscow further outside europe and the west , leaving her with no alternative but to deepen ties to a rising china. why would a moral nation arm ukraine to fight a longer and larger war with russia that kiev could not win , but that could end up costing the lives of ten of thousands more ukrainians ? on the 2008 georgian war which is often cited in recent times as expansionist putin s first geopolitical adventure georgia invaded south ossetia , a tiny province that had won its independence in the 1990s . georgian artillery killed russian peacekeepers , and the georgian army poured in . only then did the russian army enter south ossetia and chase the georgians back into their own country . the aggressor of the russogeorgia war was not vladimir putin but president mikheil saakashvili . on the rank russophobia to be found on capitol hill we seem to support every ethnic group that secedes from russia , but no ethnic group that secedes from a successor state . this is rank russophobia masquerading as democratic principle . what do the people of crimea , transnistria , georgia , abkhazia , south ossetia , luhansk or donetsk want ? do we really know ? do we care ? .. this is not to even mention the excellent analyses of people like robert parry and noam chomsky who have , to varying degrees been able to see the wood from the trees when it comes to deciphering the follies of american policy on ukraine and russia . robert parry blew the whistle on the iran contra scandal . he now writes in URL he 's very good .	cojr3yg	worldpolitics

further down in that document war was seen to be inevitable , or at the very least , highly probable , if these purposes were to be accomplished . the german people , therefore , with all their resources were to be organised as a great politicalmilitary army , schooled to obey without question any policy decreed by the state . if we are to look at the parallels between hitler 's actions in wwii and the actions of the bush administration in the leadup and execution of the war in iraq , we see that the administration also employed false and misleading propaganda to gain public support . and i do n't believe the citizens of germany were tried post wwii , but rather the nazi government . let me be perfectly clear i believe bush and his cohorts should absolutely be tried for war crimes for the atrocities committed . and i believe the american soldiers who committed war crimes must also be held accountable , by american courts or international . i was n't of voting age at the time , and i had no voice in my government or its actions . so should i be subject to the whims of an invading country that is not sanctioned by the un or any international committee ? because that is what was implied by the post i responded to . that post did not state that an international committee should hold those soldiers , that government , or any civilians accountable . it stated that the entire country is fair game for a sovereign state to take over . and i responded by asking whether the united states should be usurped by the country it imposed upon , or by another aggressive state . to even bring up an international court is not valid in this case , because neither my post nor the one i responded to was talking about that . but even if you do , there is no precedent for the civilians of a country being held accountable by an international court . the government absolutely . not the civilians of that country , however . edited for spelling and emphasis .	cqpk1xd	worldpolitics

well , i do n't run these events but here 's my two cents . suppose you 're the head of the dnc , you do n't run the debate , but you do make deals with the networks that do and you are therefore able to chose which one you 're most comfortable with , i.e . the one who agrees to run it your way . do n't forget that your main objective as head of the dnc , is to get a democrat elected , therefore your job is not necessarily about being fair to all candidates , but more about nominating the person who has the the best chance to get elected . so now , with that in mind , would you like to dismantle your front runner and drive down hisher approval rating so that less people will vote for himher and vote for another , weaker not as popular candidate , or maybe even vote republican on account of people wanting nothing to do with hillary clinton 's lies '' or bernie 's socialist ideas remember that this a capitalist nation , a very proud one at that , bernie might have some good ideas , but capitalism is the american way and it got us this far , why fuck with it now . or would you like for the debate to turn into a roast '' of hillary where the moderators spend 40 minutes out of the hour or two you have available in a back and forth exchange of people calling hillary out on her changes of mind and her explaining , mostly politician bs'ing really , why she changed her mind . so now instead of talking about what they plan to do about stuff that matters , they are talking about bengahzi or keystone instead of climate change , the wage gap , or whatever issue you actually care about . i 'm sure the people running the debates would love to have more time and have the chance to ask difficult questions . i , as a voter , would sure like to see people as they are and they have been so that i could make an informed decision . as the head of the dnc , i would like to have a good debate and get people to vote for our candidates because of how transparent and well guided the party is . but network time costs money , a very finite resource for the dnc . as much as it sucks to say this , this is not a country where people make informed decisions . a good bunch of people have already made up their minds about how they are voting and it does n't really have a lot to do with the candidate , so maybe it 's best to talk yourself out of some votes , which may go in favor of the wrong '' candidate , but your candidate nonetheless .	cy6lovj	worldpolitics

most of the time , arabs and jews live in peace together in israel . it 's far better than a lot of other countries in the middle east where jews have been expelled , and christians slaughtered . i just have no idea how you can say this while the longest occupation in modern history is going on and israel just authorized lethal force for rock throwing in land the un says they have no right to be in . or israel shooting anyone who tries to provide humanitarian aid to gaza the boat lifts . or the israeli navy shooting any gazian boat which tries to fish in its own waters . or the erecting of a separation wall , the demolishing of homes , the difficulty of arabs to travel even a mile in israel without hours of red tape . so , what are you talking about when you say jews and arabs live in peace together ? on the other hand , i know of no such systematic persecution going on in iran even though the mossad goes in there periodically and assassinates scientists . it 's interesting you chose saudi arabia and pakistan as examples of extreme fanatic religious states , which except for israel , are the two arab states most supported by the us . iran by contrast is a moderate muslim state with voting , a nationalist secular state . it turns out the us does n't like democracies in the middle east . they 're much harder to control than religious fanatic totalitarian states . in nationalist states , people get the idea that the oil coming out of the ground belongs to them , not some usuk oil company . the us wants to discourage that so they get israel to beat up on them . israel is our cop on the beat '' , as a state dept memo said . so the us most supports israel , saudi arabia , and pakistan , which says something to me already about israel to be in that group .	cw65xab	worldpolitics

'' no , i 'm not going to play this game with you where i grant states the right to do anything irrespective of historical context . a jewish state is an inherently racist concept because it demands that israel maintain a jewish majority for it to even have any legitimacy . in the next 30 years , such a task will be impossible since the arab population will be much higher than jews living in israel , which is why netanyahu is scrambling to get the jews of europe and the us to come to israel so the demographics do n't work against him . i 'm sick of this racist state '' bullshit . here 's a newsflash for you every state is racist . i 'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that maybe you are a privileged white male in a privileged wealthy white western country . would the us , the uk , canada , germany etc ever allow a demographic situation where white european descent christians aren't in majority ? the western world is as implicitly white as israel is explicitly jewish . they just do n't have to say it out loud . notwithstanding the palestinians valid claims to land their forefathers had lived on which i totally grant to you , 99 of the middle east is ethnically arab , compared to the 1 that is jewish land . in many ways the palestinians already have a state it 's called jordan . 60 of jordan is palestinian . they have passports , citizenship and the vote . it 's been the actions of egypt , lebanon , syria and the saudi that have ensured the remainder remain stateless . i believe ina twostate solution , but i can also see why , in the context of history , there might be a need for one of those states to be a guaranteed sanctuary for jews . fuck hamas and fuck the plo , but i feel for the palestinian people who have had to deal with corruption and struggle for generations because of israeli colonial rule . damn shame the world is sitting on their hands and watching . yes , i agree . fuck the plo , fuck hamas , and to be honest , fuck the idf too . fuck hezbollah and iran while we 're at it . the palestinians are monumentally fucked over and have been for decades . but i do n't think the world is sitting on their hands . far greater political minds than you and me have been trying to resolve this shit for decades . it 's not so easy . let 's say israel withdraws tomorrow to pre1967 borders and closes all settlements . how long do you think it would be before a few extremists lob rockets across the border , and kill a few israelis , followed by israel bombing the absolute crap out of the nascent palestinian state ? i 'd give it 6 months tops . this would be different from the status quo how ?	crl3zln	worldpolitics

look , you can say about obama 's actions . say they were evil , that they were stupid , that they are part of a vast conspiracy that involve the gun dealers . whatever . what you can not say is that his actions were anything but reactive . the bush administration took an attack on the us by people from pakistan that were funded by saudi arabia and used that as a reason to start a ground war in iraq with no plan to sustain a working government . they started a preemptive war '' and that destabilize an entire region . they created the idea of an axis of evil composed mostly of islamic countries that where essentially against our freedom .

nuclear is very safe . there have been 3 major nuclear disasters . 3 mile island , chernobyl , and fukushima . 3 mile island was caused by leaking coolant and then am operator manually overriding the emergency cooling system leading to a partial meltdown . chernobyl was caused by operators trying to simulate a meltdown then losing control , pretty simple not to do that . and fukushima took an earthquake and a tsunami to cause a partial meltdown . 23 people were injured in japan , 50 people died in chernobyl and no one died in 3 mile island . pretty low death toll for a weapon of mass destruction . nuclear releases less radiation into the atmosphere than coal and according to a database compiled by the paul scherrer institut , from 1970 to 2008 there were 1,686 accidents in the coal industry , 531 in the oil industry and 186 involving natural gas in which five or more people died . there was just one such nuclear accident at chernobyl 25 years ago this month . '' nuclear reactors do n't blow up . they physically ca n't , they do not contain enough of the right material to produce an explosion . they meltdown and meltdowns are manageable and have so many safety features in place that they are very uncommon . new molten metal reactors actually seal themselves with metal in the case of a meltdown . source for the quote URL	d6r5jwj	worldpolitics

inaccurate evidence exactly . you can further differentiate between degrees of accuracy , confidence in your estimation , stability of the judgement process '' , how harsh are laws , how many innocents are executedexonerated , and so on . this is a theoretical problem , and on the theoretical level it 's completely possible to come up with simple play universes futures where one is bad e.g . cannibals eat the guy who would discover the cure for cancer and the other is a nice utopia e.g . dude shots cannibals . you can of course argue that we do n't live in toy universes , and we do n't even agreed on a value system , but my argument is that categorically dismissing lethal actions is pointless , even if it 's practically impossible to know the chainedcumulatedaggregated consequences of our actions . but since it 's true for even the tiniest interaction or lack of thereof we can have with the world , we should come up with acceptable approximations , and we should realize that even if it seems cruel , it 's nothing more than a very complicated costbenefit analysis , and instead of arguing about the categorical we should be arguing about how to calculate a modeled consensus of morals .	d1462dv	worldpolitics

we ban heroin now , how effective is that ? all you accomplish by banning it is making it more expensive . so now heroin addicts will sell their children for some heroin , because they ca n't afford it any other way . it would be much more useful to get them off of heroin than just letting them keep hurting other people and eventually themselves . sorry , i want clear or consistent , but i 'm talking about the sale of heroin , not the use . as was discussed like ten posts up . i should have been more clear . legalizing use and keeping sale banned is more effective than blanket legalization for a drug like heroin . although , a lot deaths from its use have been replaced by death from legal opioids . not sure why it matters but i have no problem with abortion , no problem with gay marriage . i ask because many of the libertarians '' i 've met are not that libertarian apparently . who are you to tell people what they can or ca n't do with their own bodies ? based on your abortion question i assume you 're antiabortion , considering you seem to think you know what 's best for other people . and then you want to spend even more money on mental health ? not to mention you want to catch at risk '' people , which just sounds like you trying to control people 's lives even more based on mental tests , that 's some extremist level stuff right there . i am someone who thinks that personal freedoms have reasonable limits you ca n't punch people , you ca n't steal , etc and certain types of drug use are costly so they should be targeted , but legalizing use with banning of sale is more effective than banning use . i want to control nothing , but i know that hardcore drug use has its causes usually abuse of one type or another and when people use drugs to cope , you need to replace drugs with something else . i 'd rather spend money on mental health programs to hit the root cause of drug use because if people move from drug abuse to alcohol abuse , that does n't really fix anything . and seeing as you call it mental tests '' , i assume you have no idea what you 're talking about in this area . and i 'm a member of the prochoice subreddit so you tell me . i lumped you with the other as a libertarian '' you see around .	d7046fi	worldpolitics

according to 911 truthers , the u.s. has devised a plan to counter move by putin to expose its role in the sept. 11 attacks . the plan , according to global research , involves the u.s. government frontrunning putin by releasing an alternative version of events that will implicate the saudis and thus distract the attention of americans from putin s version of events . the u.s. government will attempt to use the saudis and a few expendable individuals in the bush administration as fall guys to take the blame for an ostensibly unauthorized inside job. according to 911 truthers , those officials in the bush administration chosen to take the blame will be branded as rogue elements within the bush administration who worked with the saudis without the knowledge of the president and key officials of his administration . the noise generated by the ensuing scandal , according to 911 truthers , will thus serve to distract the public from the full blast of the implication of putin s disclosure that 911 was a false flag operation orchestrated by the government . the engineered scandal would provide convenient casus belli for the u.s. government to begin pushing for a regime change in saudi arabia like it did against saddam hussein after he ceased to serve u.s. geopolitical interests .

if the text allows itself to be interpreted as sexist than the text is the causative agent '' do i really need to mention how hypocritical it is for the western world to be criticizing islam for their religious text being potentially interpreted as sexist ? the bible is full of examples of incest , infanticide , genocide , sexism , you name it . and yet you do n't see christians offering up their first born son as a sacrifice to god these days very often . this is not because the bible does n't specifically have a passage which could be totally interpreted as condoning this . i think people who fail to bring into account that most muslim countries do not have well developed education systems and have very weak infrastructure as well as economies , and that these things have often been exacerbated in the last century by having to fight a war to remove colonizers and neo colonizers from their within their own countries . furthermore , the jizya was a tribute tax paid by non muslims , but it had nothing to do with not allowing religious minorities to worship in their own way to my knowledge . it was designed to punish nonmuslims , but are you aware of how catholic spain or protestant england were punishing non believers at this time ? two words spanish inquisition . the fact is that the attitude held by ottomans towards the religious minorities living within their own empire well into the 17th century was arguably the most tolerant in the world at its time , and those being taxed under the jizya had to acknowledge the muslim god officially , but in every other sense they were free to exercise their religions as they wished . it is just not right to criticize the ideals of islam as being responsible for the way that it is often practiced today , and to justify that statement by saying that the majority of muslims like the idea of a hijab , or anything else is no more correct than to say that since most christians supported the crusades at the time it 's scripture must have condoned it	de5y576	worldpolitics

every time progressives in the democratic party talk about basic income '' talk '' is the operative word here . they seldom do '' . even when obama was prez and the dems had both house and senate during the first 2 years , the dems would always find a way to derail progressive legislation . why ? because most of them do n't work for us . they work for their campaign contributors and are handsomely paid when they leave office as lobbyists on k street . for example , obama and the dems never even considered single payer health care until it was forced on them , and then the only thing they did was allow 2 supporters in with the hundreds that represented insurance companies . healthcare is just one issue where they fuck over all of us , not just working class whites . most people in the lower 50 of income do n't vote anyway , having learned that it 's pointless . many studies the most famous , the princeton study have pointed out when they correlated what american people want vs. what government gives them there 's no relation at all for the lowest 70 of the population . only as you move up into the 90 income bracket do you see any significant correlation between what people want and what they get from government . when you 're in the 99 bracket , they get almost everything they want . so why vote if nothing ever comes of it ? the working class are simply ignored by the party that 's supposed to be representing them . they know the democrats are n't acting in their best interests , they 're desperate , so now they 're trying their luck with the repos ... and with trump discovering that that does n't get them anywhere either . the english working class discovered this with thatcher and the americans with reagan . i do n't doubt that you 're sincere in what you say but the truth is very different . these people you refer to have been dumbed down , cheated and ignored , and they 're angry and very confused , and that 's by design . and we 're not even talking about the really poor whites , blacks , etc . they never vote .	dlvlvm9	worldpolitics

'liberals ' are still pissed after two years their rerun insider candidate , hillary lost , after her party 's rigging of their primary in her favour was exposed . the same hillary whose husband got 500,000 for a 30 minute speech in russia to putin associates , the same hillary who favoured repeal of the magnitsky act , is the geriatric helen of troy for these 'liberals , ' worthy of launching 1000 subpoenas to find out what possibly went wrong on her path to 'her turn ' at coronation .	e4wztmt	worldpolitics

he could only bring charges within 2 years , because the democrats lost the senate during the midterms . the senate would have impeached him if he tried after those 2 years . they stopped him from doing so many things while he was president , and even threatening to impeach obama if he arrested the current russian clown running for president . in those first 2 years , he had the economy , business , banking crisis , iraq , afghanistan , and a whole slew of things to take care of . he had no fucking time . which the orange clown is undoing today . he has both houses for now . like i said , obama gave the republicans a pass , and forgave them and the military types who wanted money for war . everyone should know this by now . if you do n't , you 've been living under a rock for the last 11 years then , or simply too ignorant to care .	dyunmke	worldpolitics

consider greenspan 's latest public address . in an extended interview published in the world gold council s gold investor february issue , greenspan repeated his now standard warning about the risk of coming stagflation , which would send the price of gold higher the risk of inflation is beginning to rise ... significant increases in inflation will ultimately increase the price of gold . '' as such , investment in gold now is insurance . it s not for shortterm gain , but for longterm protection. going back to his libertarian roots , it was the idea of returning to a gold standard that greenspan focused on a gold standard that he said would help mitigate risks of an unstable fiscal system like the one we have today . today , going back on to the gold standard would be perceived as an act of desperation . but if the gold standard were in place today , we would not have reached the situation in which we now find ourselves , he said. t here is a widespread view that the 19th century gold standard didn t work . i think that s like wearing the wrong size shoes and saying the shoes are uncomfortable ! it wasn t the gold standard that failed it was politics . and the punchline we would never have reached this position of extreme indebtedness were we on the gold standard , because the gold standard is a way of ensuring that fiscal policy never gets out of line .	e1jriu3	worldpolitics

this is the radicalization caused by the controlled media , that helped in creating a leftist attitude causing thousands of people including moderate liberals who were natives of california to move out by the droves . i know this because i have spoken with a lot of them . the washington post has been turned into a hard leftist rag , and owned by bezos who 's in bed with the cia . you 're essentially citing propaganda . i know you will only trust '' liberal sources of news so here you go cia , amazon bezos , and wp URL also , cia psyop operation mockingbird to control the population through the news '' URL keep in mind , whether you love , hate , or do n't care about trump , the us corporate media is a propaganda machine for control , that has been blatantly obvious for a while especially right after trump won the election . they also played the conservatives and the right during the early part of the iraq and afghanistan wars . i served in the military back around the mid2000 's and they were showing fox news everywhere espousing the neocons . now they 're playing the liberals and the left and have been under obama . this built up and went into overdrive towards antitrump rhetoric when they realized hillary lost the election , and cnn , nyt , wp , and more are the main culprits , espousing neoliberal views . notice how they show cnn in public places now . from this small example of media analysis from my perspective the powers that be '' have implemented a false left vs. right paradigm to conquer and divide '' the country , for easier control and manipulation . there 's really not much difference between both neo '' groups , both have destructive , extremist agendas at the expense of the middle class , and the world . time to wake up to this nonsense and stop parroting the controlled media , it 's time to bring back critical thinking , fiscal education , and civics to the population , something not taught in liberal institutions known as schools '' , for a reason . edit reddit is a predominantly leftist corporate owned website , so it 's no surprise i get downvoted for thinking with my own mind .	e0hy321	worldpolitics

uh i didn t think i was stretching my guesses far enough to reach your points . the lovely country comment was more because i don t know anything about uruguay , so my assumption was that it could be just as wartorn state as the situation that legitimate asylum seekers are leaving . if it s better , then sure , maybe head there . or maybe the us is closer distancewise , and the red tape is equally annoying . or maybe the us is farther and uruguay s red tape is worse . i literally have no idea about the geopolitical nature of uruguay lol . but i feel like your response is trying to paint me as some illegal immigrantcriminal sympathizer or something . i m all about helping people in legit need of asylum . and our country has a review process for that reason . they determine if we can sustain the cost of x amount of asylum seekers , and i d guess that people actually going for asylum don t have a secret intent to breed our country dry for their massive economic gain , after they flee their country with next to nothing . but for sake of argument , let s say the us becomes wartorn or whatever . and let s say you live in utah . you re closer to mexico . do you go to mexico to seek asylum , or canada ? depending on the level of urgency , i don t think it s some horrible thing to take more one to go to the more stable and economically successful country , for the best chance to rehabilitate your life ? and idk where you got the idea that i m saying we should let everyone in ? i said that maybe despite asylum seekers knowing the us has tough red tape , that they are okay with dealing with the red tape but not dealing with the separation from families , because they weren t expecting it , because that s not how we ve reacted to asylum seekers arrival in the past from my understanding , since the red tape actually does a pretty good job of keeping out the criminals that some of them are seeking safety from . so ideally , people deserving asylum get it , we don t take in more asylum seekers than we can sustain , we do a good job of determining who is actually seeking asylum vs who is trying to sneak in with the loophole , we do a good job of working with the people arriving at the border so that they can be processed and questioned without their kids being separated from them and put in cages , and everyone has a chill time .	e0yjqen	worldpolitics

so , interesting tidbit , minimum wage is bad for the economy '' or minimum wage is bad for small businesses '' and variations thereof are common beliefs that economists have been trying , and failing to verify with data just about since the inception of the policy . what they actually find nearly every time , though , is that raising the minimum wage creates jobs and bolsters small businesses and when you stop to really think about it it 's pretty easy to see why . consider the conparison of walmart vs. local general store . walmart employs a tremendous amount of people , the local general store has like ... six . walmart is the low price leader but your local general store has better service , a better atmosphere , and you really want to support it . the thing is , lime a large chunk of the population you make within a dollar or so of the minimum wage . you have no real choice but to go with the low price leader who recoups their peofits based on volume and has prices that you 're local corner store ca n't possibly match . sure it 's only a dollar here or a dollar there , but it adds up . but then imagine your income doubles . suddenly you can pay a little extra for better service and better atmosphere . this applies not just to walmart vs. local store but also to mcdonald 's vs. local burger joint . historically , raising the minimum wage is a huge boon to small businesses because of this . unless you 're only competitive advantage is being the low price leader , more money in the pockets of the average spending consumer is good for you , not bad . this is even more prominent if you 're a small business whose market is more niche than general because more consumers can throw money your way . and i 'm not saying no small business has ever had a raise in the minimum wage be a nail in their coffin , but more often when that happens it 's the final nail in a business that was going to fail within a year anyway . if every potential customer having more money to spend does n't benefit you , your business had problems . more often than not , small businesses will say i 'll have to fire people ! '' and will instead have to hire people to deal with the increased demand .	ece3hfj	worldpolitics

crimes against the population that is at war with them and elected a terrorist government . so , not really crimes more like self defense . except they did n't elect a terrorist government , you know this conflict has been going on for 70 years ? and they have been doing these crimes way before hamas even existed , or was a leading party , which is 60 years of crimes . also your excuse is disgusting , the israelis voted in likud as their leading aprty , which is literally the successor of terrorist groups lehi , irgun and haganah . are you saying the israelis should all be killed for that ? hamas is also only present in gaza , so what about all the crimes in the west bank , which a is the bigger part of palestine and b has more palestinians living in it . you 're making zero sense and it 's getting tiring . i 'll just say it again nazi scum like yourself will eventually get punished , just like the state of israel . again every single fascist andor apartheid state has fallen in history . it 's not a coincidence . the us no longer supports palestinian statehood and never really has . they supported their own interests , which at the time included maintains public appearances . incorrect . just look it up . if they re so overwhelmingly supported , where s their statehood ? where s their asylum ? oh , that s right . nobody actually gives a fuck . they spew empty words so that others think better of them . this is global politics 101. they are recognized by 140 states , that is plenty . the only thing that denies them self determination is the occupation . that is why they defend themselves against israeli aggression . so , that being said , what on earth gives you the idea that there s going to be some massive palestinian statehood movement outside palestine ? there was already and all popular parties like the plo have been secular . pflp and dflp were founded by a christian palestinian as well , which are the third and fourth most popular parties . i really do n't care about your muslim trope since it 's irrelevant and is complety incorrect as well . i 'm getting tired by educating you , so far you have n't said a single intelligent thing or shown any knowledge on this topic . either go and educate yourself and then comeback or stop embarrassing yourself .	e9v1jqh	worldpolitics

'' stefan metzeler switzerland citizen source URL and in those other liberal countries , muslims have invaded and come in willynilly and have marched and camped all over their country committing sharia law and raping the women of those countries , and since the women are so liberal they do n't believe in abortion so they go ahead and have the baby now you got a little halfmuslim who excercises all his rights and.. you see how they start to take over the culture ?	e1i42g1	worldpolitics

far from equating hamas and all arabs , i think palestine has been abused by their arab neighbors to as destructive a degree as israel . yes fully agree with that . antisemitism and antiisraeli sentiment has been a convenient glue to hold the arab world together despite the fact that historically the entire middle east is an assortment of warring tribes and ethnic microdivisions . their support '' for palestine has been entirely selfserving and palestine has been rather notorious toward a few of them as well . its not just that , but yes using a scapegoat is easy . just like israel also does for palestinians create a common external enemy and the people will easily follow you . no difference between israel and arab nations there . palestine wo n't accept a lasting compromise because too many big players inside and outside palestine need the focus on wiping out the tiny corner of the region ruled by jews . it 's just too useful . thats simply not true , palestinians the past few decades have gotten barely any support from arab nations . palestinians abbas for eample have been asking for the last decade for peace negaotiations only to be refused by israel . netanyahu has no intrest in peace , this conflict is politicialy too important for him . and when it comes down to my life or your life , people always tend to choose my life '' for perfectly common reasons beyond good and evil . this means keep oppressing millions and with that you keep the conflict active and ever increasing in violence . its also not true , i would understand that israel is reluctant to negotiate but isreal is still increasing its settlements and driving palestinians from their lands . that is simply a land grab and has nothing to do with security , on the contrary it increases the risks . so security is just an excuse .	e0lckw2	worldpolitics

URL the evidence to support tobin taxes is thin on the ground , however . most academic studies generally agree that they may not necessarily decrease volatility in financial markets . an experimental study in 2010 by researchers at the university of innsbruck suggested that a global tobin tax would have little impact on volatility . and there is not much evidence at all that unilateral tobin taxes work . although large markets might see a fall in volatility , smaller markets would see a rise due to a fall in liquidity . even barry eichengreen , a supporter of tobin s original proposals , now argues that a european tobin tax may prove a distraction that allows systemic risks and instability to increase in other areas . for instance , according to harald hau , an economist at the swiss finance institute and the university of geneva , credit misallocation in the economy as the result of distorting equity and bond prices may make life difficult for small and medium sized business that can not raise finance from abroad . in practice tobin taxes imposed unilaterally have proved unsuccessful as markets have moved abroad to avoid them . sweden s experiments in the 1980s with a transaction tax on shares , equity derivatives and fixedincome securities ended in failure as activity moved offshore to avoid the levies . in the first week of the fixedincome tax bond trading volumes fell by 85 the amount eventually raised from the tax averaged only about 3 of what was predicted . by 1990 over 50 of swedish equity trading had moved to london . maybe bernie and his supporters should learn from those nordic countries they never shut up about . have you got any evidence that such taxes have generated adequate revenue and haven't resulted in the industry moving offshore ? or are you like 99 of bernie supporters where you just believe fantasies then talk down to anyone who is actually looking at the real world ?	euw5s0y	worldpolitics

i work in the medical insurance industry and would be happy to clear up anything for you . 1. you can purchase private insurance without your employer through the affordable care act aka obama care but the premiums are around 800 a month . 2. copay is the amount you must pay for a service before the insurance plan will even touch the bill . the varies from plan to plan . this is separate from the deductible which is the amount you must pay before the insurance kicks in , it can range from 500 to 10s of thousands . it is also separate from the premiums which is the monthly amount you pay to keep the benefits active . 3. i see people with insurance get denied services on a daily basis , in some cases waiting months for a life saving service due to the bureaucracy created by the private insurance industry . if you do not have insurance you better have a large bank account or you wont get treatment for chronic conditions , only services meant to stabilize such as stop you from bleeding out at the er however , you will be billed massive amounts for that service .	f85qen1	worldpolitics
