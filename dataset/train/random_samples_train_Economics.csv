i 've found many austrians overstate the flaws of frb , what happens is that you give some amount of money to banks on a demand deposit , and they set aside some portion of that deposit as insurance , the reserve requirement , and loan at the rest , hence the term fractional reserve . arguing that the reserve requirement is too low zero URL in the case of accounts worth less than 9.3 million dollars is perfectly reasonable , but a reserve requirement of 30 , combined with strict rules on lending requirements , would be more than adequate to stave off the panics that lead to bank runs . note that the current crisis is only indirectly caused by frb in much the same way as it was only indirectly caused by using money as a medium of exchange , the much more direct cause was a systemically flawed allocation of loaning resources e.g . into subprime mortgages the system you propose to make loans does not technically satisfy a strict 100 reserve requirement , if a single borrower defaults then i no longer have the resources on hand to meet my obligations . note that this is only a problem in the face of systemic defaulting otherwise i have several years to make up the balance , but this is precicely the flaw you are trying to fix by eliminating frb . it also seems like you would also have to charge very high interest rates to cover that risk . your comment that the boombust cycles did not begin until after the civil war is factualy untrue , they started as soon as capitalist economies formed and next to the bank of amsterdam , which you praise for not using fractional reserve banking methods . from the wikipedia URL many economic historians regard the netherlands as the first thoroughly capitalist country in the world . in early modern europe it featured the wealthiest trading city amsterdam and the first fulltime stock exchange . the inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as such less benign phenomena as the boombust cycle , the world 's first assetinflation bubble , the tulip mania of 16361637 , and according to murray sayle , the world 's first bear raider isaac le maire , who forced prices down by dumping stock and then buying it back at a discount . the amount of gold in the world is not very stable like all finite resources it has a peak and it is estimated that peak occurred in 2000 URL . amusingly , part of that is due to increased demand by the electronics industry . fixing the money supply to a constant has no direct correlation with productivity . it would arguably limit the gains due to productivity increases , due to there being a less immediately available funds for research b high interest rates as per your loan scheme and c a fixed capacity economy my second point in my previous post . there is also fairly good reason to maintain a low but constant rate of inflation we ca n't control it with very fine grain accuracy being influenced in part by powerful and largely unpredictable microeconomic forces , and deflation is bad URL , so we give ourselves a small margin of error by trying to achieve a constant but positive amount of inflation , usually 3 . small amounts of inflation also encourage investment , as you are penalized for just sitting on your money , and increased investment in turn grows the economy .	c03pizl	Economics

every subprime mortgage and home sale generated transaction fees for real estate agents , title companies , mortgage brokers , banks , investment banks , financial institutions and insurers . the churn in home sales also brought in a lot of money to developers and anyone associated with the construction industry . each of these mortgages , on its way to becoming a small piece of a fraudulently insured security , brought in a chunk of income for brokers and those involved in real estate . everyone got a piece of something from the deal . the big investment houses could keep paying their bosses what they expected to be paid , and people down the food chain got their share as well . there were a few surprise winners i found out about paper home buyers who would ask a seller to inflate a home price in exchange for a cut of the sale price of the property . the paper seller then split with the 50,000 to 100,000 difference between the asking price and the selling price , and the bank or , rather , the tax payer was left holding the debt .	c05rcgb	Economics

i just lost my job , after a steady , 2yearlong decrease in income . this financial crisis has been hitting me for a while now i was making 810kmonth in 2006 , working as a consultant for a big software company . then last year the financial shit began to hit the fan , their stock started to fall , and my whole department was eventually downsized and absorbed into another department . could n't find work for a good 3 months , until i finally got another client last december . had to take a big pay cut , too down to 5kmonth . this company started struggling a few months back , downsized again , and had me making 4kmonth until they just could n't afford to keep me anymore they 're not getting any work themselves . got my contract cancelled about a month and a half ago . so i 've gone from making about 100 grand a year , down to 50 , down to zero . i do n't think i 'm doing this right .	c06loup	Economics

after all , is n't that what the profession is all about ? helping people ? lots of professions claim to be about helping people . lawyers perform pro bono work well , the good ones do , even businessmen of good standing in their community perform charity work . that does n't change the fact that our health care system suffers from a parasitic synergy of overregulation , underfunding , and the artificially created market for private sector group health insurance to the detriment of individual plans and individuals who wish to opt out . in most countries with the sort of cash flow that the usa enjoys , the citizens have decided that socialized basic health care is important enough to bite the bullet . here , there is an enormous amount of excess profit generated by the thirdparty healthinsurance industry , and that profit is plowed back into lobbying against a sensible healthcare system . it costs more and delivers less , per dollar , than almost any alternative but that 's what frees up all the excess cash to go into corporate profits . if you are rich enough , none of this matters socialized or not , you 'll be buying the best . but for the people in this article , socialized health care is clearly the only kind they can afford . if medicaremedicaid were forced upon all licensed practicioners , and conversely a fair price for their services agreed upon , the only party that would really suffer in the end would be the health insurance industry . i do n't hear too many people complaining that doctors fail to earn their money . i do n't see anyone claiming that hmostyle plans 'earn ' their 33 to 50 administrative overhead and that is before the usual backandforth attempts to deny legitimate bills from providers and legitimate claims from patients this is exceptionally well documented , try googling uhc 's travails with john garamendi and others but , like gay marriage and gun control , the 'physician choice ' nonissue will inevitably be brought up , or something else like it , when it comes time to consider a socially responsible system for basic care . if we can even afford it our deficitfunded wars and wall street bailouts may make that impossible .	c04xxkx	Economics

they want someone to tell them everything is going to be ok. yes , i think that is true . i will add that a substantial part of the part of the population want politicians to not only tell them that everything is going to be ok , but also to actually make things ok , i.e . they want politicians to act . when a substantial part of the population cease to think that their lives are important enough to both make a difference and make their own lives better , then this is absolutely horrible for society . people grow up in a country where they are controlled from cradle to grave , however bad that system is . since state control in economics makes things worse and never makes things better in the long run , people experience an unnecessarily hard life , which they attribute to freedom , even though they and others really do n't have it . they are indoctrinated since birth thinking that they are living in a free country '' . therefore all the problems that occur from state control they attribute to freedom itself . they thus start to attack freedom , as if freedom is the problem . but one can not attack concepts , such as freedom , terrorism , etc . one can only attack other people . an attack on freedom is thus necessarily an attack on other people . what happens therefore is that a society that starts to not trust freedom will eventually become selfdestructive . the proof of this is easy to see where is america being attacked right now ? from the external or the internal ? where is the source of the problems ? the source is america itself obviously . how could this have happened ? america is giving up on freedom , and the selfresponsibility that goes along with it . instead of letting people be free , the us government and its central bank have stopped people from being selfreliant . for the last 15 years , the fed has not let americans deal with the problems the government and the fed created . that 's why i think they are in such bad shape . the scary thing is that the us government thinks that as long as they personally have freedom , then it does n't matter if lesser '' americans under them do n't have freedom , because they will be led . but this is clearly false . you ca n't take it upon yourself to adopt '' 100 people by force and then expect to be able to do what you want once they are totally dependent on you . for that is what has happened . the us government has adopted '' american business by constantly helping '' it . they have helped '' big business so much by privileged access to cheap credit , by laws that benefit local companies , by coercion etc that big business now can not even function in the free market anymore . the government and the fed feel responsible for what they have done , and so they feel like they have to act to fix their own mess . but doing so will only make the problems worse , because what needs to happen for recovery is for business to make decisions and act in the absence of government coercion . it will hurt , yes , but it needs to happen . any attempt to help '' business along the way would be like expecting a child to ride a bike on his own even if you keep holding on to the seat . the seat needs to be let go '' . if there are some bumps and bruises along the way , then so be it . in the long run , the market will be stronger coming out . the government seriously needs to realize that the problems stem from government actions . they need to take a long look in the mirror and stop blaming others for what it did . this is of course impossible because even if politicians blame the government for what happened , they would necessarily be blaming other people , namely previous politicians . when the government starts blaming particular government politicians , they think that they can fix the mess that previous administrations made because of hubris . but they ca n't do that . they are only going to make more and bigger problems . bush thought he could fix the mess that the clinton administration created , and so too does obama . nobody understands that they have to stop the central banking system . they blame the poor economy on everything other than inflation .	c06hi4u	Economics

but people should be seeking currency by putting their efforts to productive purposes , not by trying to dig more of the currency out of the ground . when you consider the fact that a worldwide gold standard would significantly increase the value of gold , you would see a huge increase in the amount of effort going to digging for gold rather than for productive uses . also , because the gold standard is inherently deflationary , you would see a rise in saving vs. investing in productive capital , which would be quite unfortunate . during bad market environments and other asset panics , there would be a greater flight to cash than we 've seen this time , even , because you would be assured that inflation would n't destroy the value of your cash . the net result of this flight to safety is inevitably the end of the gold standard . that is one reason why the gold standard is not a realistic alternative for the world , unfortunately . many of my favorite ideas are also not politically viable .	c06jpl4	Economics

i mean , presumably the stock market is built on something at its base . since shares of a company are fractions of a company , it seems the company and therefore shares should have some sort of inherent worth , built on the company 's resources , future profits , etc . could the economy really have accelerated since the 1980s like the picture is leading me to believe ? or is it all just illusory , with people driving up the prices of the shares simply because they expect later someone else will buy them in the hopes of the same ? if all the gains are simply number gains from this stock market game , and do n't reflect underlying increases in business earnings , productivity , etc , then is it sustainable ? will it all have to come crashing down to its inherent '' value at some point ? if so , what would that value be ? let 's assume it will have to come crashing down to its inherent value , which has been increasing at some lower rate than the djia . what would that real '' increase look like ? i 'd imagine it could be approximated linearly ? if so , linearly how ? it seems the slope established from 19001960 is different from 19601980 is different from 19801995. is it possible that the real '' growth in the economy changed at any of those years . maybe computers have allowed the businesses in the djia to grow at a faster rate than in the past . then again , maybe things really are growing exponentially , as the graph seems to indicate . how long can exponential growth be maintained ? this seems impossible to me . the s p 500 URL shows a similar pattern . perhaps now is the time to buy dog URL , which basically is the opposite of the djia ?	c05owdy	Economics

the important thing to remember is that when talking about the futures price of a commodity , is that the price describes the value delivered to a specific location . futures contracts are contracts for delivery , thus they need someplace to be delivered to . so if i buy a nymex dec 2008 gold futures the spot month and wait for delivery i will receive physical gold or rather a redeemable receipt at the price i paid for the futures . this is a futures transaction in the spot '' or delivery month . the price i paid is the value delivered in new york to one of about five banks . now imagine i am a jeweler living in oregon . in order to secure a consistent supply of gold , i could buy futures and take delivery , but this is unwieldy , i would end up taking delivery at a bank in new york . so i will have to request loadout '' and pay the bank fees associated with assaying , insuring , and transporting my gold to oregon . so instead of the delivery i find a regional or local wholesaler from whom i can find the ingots or bars i need . this is convenient because transportation fees and logistics are likely cheaper due to proximity . i can buy my immediate and future needs through the wholesaler a simple cash for physical '' transaction . such transactions comprise the cash market '' . i can secure future supply by forward purchasing '' through my wholesaler . i would essentially be buying physical gold for delivery in the future , at my specified location . herein lies the distinction . the futures are securities with specific legal obligations for delivery specified by the deliverer and in accordance with the exchange 's rules . a cash market transaction is between private parties for an agreed upon quantity at an agreed upon price at an agreed upon location . spot price '' refers to the price of a thing now ... at its current price . the spot month '' refers to the nearby delivery month so why the convoluted explanation ? my point about backwardation is that in times of short supply or high demand , it will show up first in the cash market . the oregon jeweler or industrial user will pay up first , being the end users . the wholesaler , seeing demand increase or finding it difficult to find gold himself , may decide that he needs to cover his ass and buy futures . while he may buy futures , he is also unlikely to take delivery since his supply comes from a refiner . for most players , the futures are merely a hedge against higher prices and not as a means to secure future supply . to your earlier question how a cash market can be in backwardation . this happens when i am paying my wholesaler more for gold now than what he will charge me for the forward purchase of the same quantity . he 'll do this because the price he is charging me is more than what he paid for his forward purchases . this could be possible for any number of reasons perhaps the nearby shortage of gold will be satisfied when a new mine comes online in six months but the market wants gold now . i hope i explained this well enough . please ask again if this is unclear . caveat futures markets will sometimes invert before the cash due to demand for the value represented by the commodity , rather than the commodity itself . such is the case in gold i am sure . it is unlikely that industrial or luxury demand is what is behind current price structure . this is about a shortage of the futures rather than the gold itself .	c06ufn1	Economics

and i 'm not speaking about secondary owners . '' why not ? do ordinary laws of supply and demand not apply to secondary markets ? somehow i 'm not aware of any tft factory in pakistan . '' i do n't see how that 's relevant . in any case , as this article points out , the chaebol sought financing through equity but could n't convince investors to get on board because they could n't get good bond ratings URL and a substantial portion of fdi in emerging markets is channeled through large cap index funds . there 's little discrimination as to specific industries . killing some 2 millions of ukrainians in order to export some ukrainian grain is not exactly a sustainable business model . '' and south korea 's business model was sustainable ? on the other hand , export oriented industries even in socialist countries were in better shape than the bulk of all other . '' interestingly , the soviet defense industry was able to survive the collapse of the ussr and now russian defense manufacturers are in fact highly competitive in foreign markets . URL '' the case of managers not meeting production standards is often enough a case of corruption , which is a criminal offense . '' in south korea , corruption was a way of life , not a criminal offense . the article states that the regulations that people were being jailed for violating pertained to monthly export performance reports , entry restrictions , and regulations on capacity expansion . '' can you explain how the very notion of regulating those things in the first place is compatible with free market capitalism ? and it was a lot more successful in markets which the sk gov . did not control , than in the domestic markets . '' well of course , since there was a lot more money to be made in foreign markets to begin with . but the companies had to obey the government 's rules , whether they were selling their goods at home or abroad . hyundai motors did not transform into a different company when it started selling cars in california . as i mentioned before , the chaebol were late getting into consumer electronics because they were expressly forbidden from competing in that market until well after japanese manufacturers had snapped up a dominant share of that market . samsung and lg might have conceivably been more successful had they been allowed to compete with sony and panasonic in the 1970s , but the korean government told them to stay out of ce and focus on heavy industries instead . for whatever reason , the government was nervous about direct competition between the chaebol and the keiretsu in certain consumer sectors . it saw construction and shipbuilding as being niche markets that were ripe for exploitation correctly , it turned out , so that 's where korean manufacturing was directed . as i mentioned , vietnam , malaysia , thailand and indonesia have all tried this approach and have all failed . every time they target a specific export market , china runs them out of town . it 's not as simple as finding some other market and exercising competitive advantage . '' these countries have no competitive advantages against china . and neither would south korea if it were starting from the same position today . if vietnamese manufacturers decide to invest in production of some new widget , which china does not manufacture , it 's a safe bet that with 34 years china will not only be manufacturing that widget but will be manufacturing it in such enormous quantities as to flood the market and drive down the price until it is no longer a very lucrative endeavor . this is beginning to happen in the plastics industry right now .	c04s6is	Economics

i agree with you somewhat , i think the article is mostly talking about the people who have aspirations of wealth , and the hours worked '' difference between them and the lower paid people . i make good money , and do n't have a physically demanding job , but lately , i seem to have no money left over ... much of it is prior obligations to investments and that sort of thing which the lower class '' would never be involved in , but even outside of that , i am having trouble paying off last years taxes and my utilities bill is racked up pretty high . so , i am working longer hours to try to catch up . in addition , in my profession software i constantly have to be learning . ya , i make good per hour , but when joe sixpack goes home and watches foxnews and the simpsons , i 'm working on personal projects that i hope to turn into money someday , and at the very least will teach me new skills . i do n't mind it too much because i find it interesting , but it hurts my family life the wife gets mad , and its no guarantee of a payoff . if any of my side projects ever did work out , i would surely be taxed to death . so if i was to give advice to a young person entering the workforce now or choosing a profession ... choose something that is socially undesirable maybe plumbing , or another trade , something that will not impress people when you tell them what you do , and if you are business savvy , you can parlay it into a business of your own and do very well . i do agree and have seen and read a lot about the finance professionals '' that work ungodly hours , and its true , depending on how you define work . they do put in a lot of time , but if you are even remotely aware of what is happening in the financial world lately , their work is actually causing more harm than good i do n't think this is even debatable anymore . i know a few people in this line of work , and they genuinely think that what they do is very important ... for example , they unlock value '' in companies , and things like that . indeed . if you look at the actual mathematics of it , they strip value off , put into into their own pocket , sell the remainder to a shell company that borrowed money , which then subsequently defaults on their loan . and then the bank goes to the government and sells them the loans which they already took their nice commissions on for closing the deal '' for face value , even though they 're worthless . then , they have all this fresh new money to go play around in another arena , like oil futures . meanwhile , the taxpayer is left holding the bag to pay back china for all the money we borrowed to pull this stuff off . our financial markets are broken . long standing rules are changes at a moments notice . the most important commodity in the world , oil , moves 5 in one day . the us debt is rising at what , 1 trillion per year do n't reference the deficit numbers as they leave out lots of things , look athe the debt numbers . politicians will not answer hard questions . people peacefully demonstrating in the street are being arrested . most of the media asks no questions , or if they do , they accept the talking point from the candidate . reporters that do n't accept that are being arrested . john straight talk express '' no longer accepts interviews . barrack obama is one of the greatest orators of all time , but he never addresses any of the real issues america has . it is a sad situation . so back to the original point , who works more than others ... i wonder if it does n't really matter all that much . the economy is so controlled and disjointed right now , that the people who will fair best i suspect are the ones who just happened to be in the right place . look , people used to save for literally decades to get 10 or 20 or 100 thousand dollars in the bank . in the last few years , people were flipping properties and making that much in six months ... so , older retirees '' , who worked for decades , and saved hard denying themselves many various luxuries , to save a nest egg of 100,000 or maybe 200,000 , see college droputs literally suddenly making 100,000 200,000 flipping a single property , in anything from 6 months to 2 years with no money down by the way . so , 20 years of hard work and savings is equalled in a few hours of work search a property , call the mortgage broker , call the realtor , close the deal . so the smart ones walk away with hundreds of thousands of dollars in their pocket . all the finance company employees took their bonuses , the homebuilder ceo 's took their bonus . and then the last guy in the chain takes the loss when the ponzi scheme collapses . but then he 's not the one that takes the loss he declares bankruptcy , and the loan company is on the hook , but as it turns out , the loan company sold the loan off the fannie mae of freddie mac , who will be bailed out by the fed , so then , ultimately , who is left holding the bag ? thats right , the person who lived frugally , worked har , and did n't piss their money away swinging for the fences . this is the financial system we live in today . this is what your leaders call capitalism '' . this is not capitalism a system that privatizes profits , and socializes losses , is not capitalism . 50 years ago , these people would be in prison . 100 years ago they would n't even think about it , because one of their neighbors would form a lynch mob and kill them , for the massive theft . but this is where we are today . this happens regularly , with no prosecution or investigation , even though these actions violate security laws already in place . the politicians say nothing . are they in the pockets of the lobbiests ? why does n't barrack say anything ? does he genuinelly not see any of this happening ? who knows . so ... from what i read and have thought about and this is by no means a prediction , the people living in smalls towns with a relatively local economy if that is possible anymore with no debt , will fare best . owning your house outright , a job that can not be outsourced , good relations with the members of your community , a small community of good people . i think it comes down to fundamentals ... the american economy produces a finite amount of tangible wealth , but the wealth tangible goods being consumed is far beyond that which american workers produce . look at the labels of your consumer goods ... almost everything is made in china , or at least somewhere in asia . workers over there make less than 1 per hour . the only reason we have not noticed a change in our standard of living because of the distortion of the free market is because we have literally millions of workers making less than 1 per hour working 12 hour days and sleeping in subhuman by our standards dorms . and to top it all off , they lend us a large percentage of the money to buy the good they produce ! ! if someone told you this story you would n't believe it , it 's too absurd ! ! ! well , thats all i have to say about that .	c059xfg	Economics

richard leakey , the eminent paleoanthropologist , says war did n't exist until men invented agriculture and began to acquire possessions . in the back of leakey 's mind , one hears a wistful prayer that agriculture would go away so we could rediscover peace . but leaky is very wrong . violence is not a product of the digging stick and hoe . in the kalahari desert of southern africa live a people called the ! kung . the ! kung have no agriculture and very little technology . they live off the fruit and plants their women gather and the animals their men hunt . their way of life is so simple that hordes of anthropologists have studied them , convinced that the ! kung live as our ancestors must have over ten thousand years ago , before the domestication of plants . in the early years of ! kung ethnography , anthropologists became wildly excited . these simple people had no violence , they said . anthropology had discovered the key to human harmony abolish the modern world and return to hunting and gathering . richard leakey used the ! kung as his model of paradisal preagriculturists . the ! kung way of life proved that without the plow , men would not have the sword . yet later studies revealed a blunt and still underpublicized fact . ! kung men solve the problem of adultery through murder . as a result , the ! kung have a homicide rate higher than that in new york . ! kung violence takes place primarily between individuals . in both humans and animals , however , the greatest violence occurs not between individuals but between groups . it is most appalling in war . diane fossey , the woman who devoted nineteen years to living among and observing the mountain gorillas of central africa 's virunga mountains , felt these creatures were among the most peaceful on earth . yet mountain gorillas become killers when their social groups come face to face . clashes between social units , said fossey , account for 62 of the wounds on gorillas . 74 of the males fossey observed carried the scars of battle , and 80 had canine teeth they 'd lost or broken when trying to bite the opposition . fossey actually recovered skulls with canine cusps still embedded in their crests . one gorilla group will deliberately seek out another and provoke a conflict . the resulting battles between gorilla tribes are furious . one of the bands that fossey followed was led by a powerful silverback , an enormous male who left a skirmish with his flesh so badly ripped that the head of an arm bone and numerous ligaments stuck out through the broken skin . the old ruling male , whom fossey called beethoven , had been supported in the fight by his son , icarus . icarus left the battle scene with eight massive wounds where the enemy had bitten him on the head and arms . the site where the conflict had raged was covered with blood , tufts of fur , broken saplings and diarrhetic dung . such is the price of prehuman war in the virunga mountains . gorillas are not the only subhumans to cluster in groups that set off to search for blood . in the early '70s , jane goodall had lived fourteen years among the wild chimpanzees of tanzania 's gombe reserve . she loved the chimps for their gentle ways , so different from the violence back home among humans . yes , there were simian muggings , beatings and rage . but the ultimate horror war was absent . goodall published a landmark book on chimpanzee behavior in the shadow of man a work which to some proved unequivocally that war was a human creation . after all , the creatures shown by genetic and immunological research to be our nearest cousins in the animal kingdom knew nothing of organized , wholesale violence . then , three years after goodall 's book emerged , a series of incidents occurred that horrified her . the tribe of chimps goodall had been watching became quite large . food was harder to find . quarrels broke out . to relieve the pressure , the unit finally split into two separate tribes . one band stayed in the old home territory . the other left to carve out a new life in the forest to the south . at first the two groups lived in relative peace . then the males from the larger band began to make trips south to the patch of land occupied by the splinter unit . the marauders ' purpose was simple to harass and ultimately kill the separatists . they beat their former friends mercilessly , breaking bones , opening massive wounds , and leaving the resultant cripples to die a slow and lingering death . when the raids were over , five males and one elderly female had been murdered . the separatist group had been destroyed . its sexually active females and part of its territory had been annexed by the males of the band from the home turf . jane goodall had discovered war among the chimpanzees . it was a discovery she had hoped she would never make . years later , biological ecologist michael ghiglieri traveled to uganda to see just how widespread chimpanzee warfare really was . he concluded that '' the happygolucky chimpanzee has turned out to be the most lethal ape an organized , cooperative warrior ... '' so the tendency toward slaughter that manifested itself in the chinese cultural revolution is not the product of agriculture , technology , television or materialism . it is not an invention of either western or eastern civilization . in fact , it is not a uniquely human proclivity at all . it comes from something both sub and superhuman , something we share with gorillas , apes , fish and ants a brutality that speaks to us through the animals in our brain . if man has contributed anything of his own to the equation , it is this he has learned to dream of peace . but to achieve that dream , he will have to overcome what nature has built into him .	1ylq	Economics

the issue is that any spending plan '' a budget regardless of whether it raises revenue or spending still requires a 23 vote in both houses . i looked but could find no reference to a requirement of a 23 majority to simply pass a budget perhaps you can point me to it . from my reading , even a spending increase only requires a simple majority . which , if accurate , goes a long way to explain massive state debt . what i was referring to and thought you were as well was california constitution , article 13a URL , section 3 , which states from and after the effective date of this article , any changes in state taxes enacted for the purpose of increasing revenues collected pursuant thereto whether by increased rates or changes in methods of computation must be imposed by an act passed by not less than twothirds of all members elected to each of the two houses of the legislature , except that no new ad valorem taxes on real property , or sales or transaction taxes on the sales of real property may be imposed .	c09u2mp	Economics

sure . the government gets the money that it uses for its spending programs from the market . it can not spend any money without having the money first . therefore every dollar they spend is a dollar that has been taken away from the market . if the money was first taken away from the market , then any demand for labor the government can create by its spending must be faced with a dollar for dollar decrease in demand for labor in the market . so far there is no net nominal gain or loss in the demand for labor , because what demand for labor is lost in the market is matched by an equivalent rise in demand for government paid labor . now , i said that government spending programs decreases employment , so where is the additional loss ? the additional loss is created by an overall decrease in the productivity of the american economy . when jobs are lost in the private sector , and replaced by government paid jobs , then this is just another way of saying that unproductive jobs are created and productive jobs are lost . how does it do this ? you might be thinking to yourself that not all government jobs are totally useless , in that some jobs will produce roads and bridges , etc . but the key thing you have to be aware of is that not only will most of the money be lost in a maze of bureaucracy , but in addition to that , the government itself has absolutely no sure way of knowing if the jobs it creates are productive , for it does not have the required information to know if they are productive or not . they do not have a price system , that is , they do not have profit and loss tests to confirm if the government spending programs are productive or if they are wasteful . what wasteful production does is make the us lose its competitiveness compared to the rest of the world . other countries become more competitive compared to the us , and that means more jobs overseas , and less jobs here at home . this is precisely why n. korea is not an economic powerhouse , and japan is . in n. korea , 100 of production is carried out by the korean communist government . in japan , most production is carried out in the price system , in the profit and loss system . any policy movement towards places like n. korea , and away from laissezfaire capitalism , will make the us economy less productive , and less jobs will be available . a completely different proof is merely to consider that government spending programs are designed to increase consumption . but wages do not come out of consumption , they come out of savings and capital . the more the government spends on consumption , the less savings are available to pay wages . this is the reason why the new deal government spending programs did n't cure the great depression in the 1930s , and why a 23 decrease in government spending in 1946 did cure it .	c0a1zic	Economics

well you maybe are confused as to the roles of these two institutions . the treasury is the branch of government that collects taxes and disburses money for government expenditures . the treasury is kind of like the government 's accountant . the federal reserve is the bank that the treasury uses . when the government needs more money than it takes in through taxes , it must borrow the money . the treasury issues securities and borrows money from the public . many of these securities are then purchased by the fed . so it is actually the treasury that owes money to the fed . the treasury borrows money , albeit indirectly , from the fed . a government security is a liability of the treasury , and an asset of the fed . when the treasury securities mature , the treasury pays the fed . for this reason , the people who made both videos think that escaping the debt is impossible and that the fed is a conspiracy to rob all wealth from the people . however , the videos fail to mention or realize that the money which the treasury pays to the fed is returned , or rebated , to the treasury each year . the principal and interest that the treasury pays on the bonds is returned to them ! so , essentially , treasury securities that are held by the fed are interest free loans ! when the fed purchases government securities on the open market , our government 's debt actually goes down ! effectively , one arm of government is buying back the debt of another arm of government . since it all ends up the same place , it is a good thing .	c07hg50	Economics

the biggest mistake of all , when talking about economics , is thinking that it might actually be possible to create fundamental laws that always hold true like you can in hard sciences . this is because economics is not controlled by rules , it is driven by behaviour . as soon as you could prove , with evidence , that , say , the stock market will go down because of x. because everyone knows that is what is going to happend , they will adjust their bevaiour , and that will change the situation , making the proof no longer true . we would all love if economics could produce laws and proofs , but in fact , we actually know that such a thing is not possible	99fw	Economics
thanks for some perspective . realistically , when a bank goes under it is nationalized look at indiemac . i guess it really comes down to weighing how much capital we would lose to keep a bank floating vs how much capital the fdic would be obligated to pay out to investors . if we invest a shitload of money into the banks and they still go under then we 're out both . so which option would be cheaper to the taxpayer ? so far as i know , if a bank failed the fdic would essentially take over or nationalize the bank and pay it 's account holders claims while auctioning off it 's assets and using that money to further pay its obligations . in my opinion , the money we 're putting in right now is probably just disappearing as shareholders withdrawal and banks mark down the value of assets they ca n't sell , essentially correcting for the real estate bust . seems like it would 've been more effective to shore up the mortgage problem , let the banks go under , clarify how much those mortgage backed securities ie 'no longer tainted assets ' are worth and let the fdic have a field day selling them . in essence it would be the fdic selling assets they 're insuring , so it would probably cost as much as selling them at low 'tainted ' cost , but without the huge real estate burst . but if the big banks go under , who steps in with the liquidity to buy the assets ? what happens to the hundreds of thousands of workers that lose their jobs , at least temporarily ? i 'm not really getting into how credit default swaps and all those other crazy ass derivatives would play into this scenario , though . the more i think about this the more i realize how complicated this is . sorry for not being an economist .. i always lead back to the same question , where did all the money go ? it could n't have disappeared .. even with all those derivatives money changes hands but does n't get created or destroyed . it has to be somewhere , right ? edit it 's almost like you have a robin hood real estate problem . the banks paid people inflated prices for houses . so really the money went to real estate agents , house flippers , and ordinary people who sold their homes for ridiculous prices . no matter how you look at it that 's the stem of the problem , and that will directly decide how much it costs to fix . the most direct way to fix it would be to somehow fix the mortgage problem instead of dealing with the many , crazy , derivative problems not to be confused with financial derivatives . fucking mouthful	c07x2r3	Economics

inflation is what happens when you raise wages . you can also say that chavez raised wages because of inflation and both statements would be true . i would say that the exchange control and the price controls are the real culprits here companies that sell rice , coffee , etc now have to sell them at a price decided unilaterally by the government , which goes below the production price of the product . that means the companies have to sell it with a loss , most this companies ' strategy have been to target higherend markets so as to have enough profits to subsidize the price controlled products , which also means that less of the regulated products are produced , and thanks to demandsupply , prices rise . the government has attacked this by forcing the producers to dedicate a percentage of what is produced to regulated products , creating bigger losses for producers . another factor weighs in when you have to import your raw material . cadivi , the government 's agency that manages the exchange control , can take months and even years to pay your suppliers , meaning you can no longer import through them you can also pay them with black market dollars , which cost as of right now 3 times the fixed price . this also presents problems when thinking about investing in the country . that why he has instituted land reform , i actually have n't seen much progress in this area , although i do think this was a good idea . for now i 'm expectant about this . import substitution if by that you mean we 've made a substitution of our own products coffee , meat , etc with imported products , then yes . in 2003 we imported 1 of the meat we used to consume , we are now URL importing 60 . and huge investments in education . same investments most of other governments would have made with such high oil prices ! as i said , chavez was blessed with that , never in this country so much money had entered before . do n't you guys even have free healthcare now ? to some extent yes . if you want some pills for a headache , you cut your finger cutting potatoes or need some xrays done , you 'll be fine going to the barrio adentros . if you need anything related to specialized medicine you 're screwed . yes , it was necessary to invest onto basic medicine , but that is no reason to undermine specialized medicine , that is without even taking into account the huge oil revenue we have been receiving during the last decade . there is no excuse neither for this nor our waterelectricity crisis .	c0fiq9b	Economics

look at other costs , as well . if you work in a big city , living on the outskirts can be very expensive . how valuable is your time and how long is your commute ? if it 's 60 minutes each way , that 's an extra 2 hours of work that you have to do just to get to work and back . it 's the equivalent of working 5 weeks a month but only getting paid for 4 assuming full time . if you make 20hour , that 's about 800 month of work that you are not getting paid for . if you have a long commute , you probably own a car . costs are , on average , 8,000 per year , or 650month . fire insurance on mobiles is a lot higher and a premium will be charged if there is not a working hydrant near enough and another will be charged if there is not a fire station near enough . resale value of mobiles tends to be low . maybe your land will appreciate in value ? the tco of a cheap mobile may be a lot higher than renting or buying a condo in a more convenient area . dump the car and your 350 is now 1000 .	c08dovu	Economics

see the previous discussion of decentralized democracy . the more someone is hurt by a decision , the more say they deserve in that decision . who determines who has what say and how valid their say is ? the state of course . why is it not the individual who decides this ? however , simply because the victim deserves '' more say , does n't mean they 'll actually get it when the time comes . right . that s because in your framework , individuals are irrelevant to the collective . thus anarchists encourage everyone to use whatever power they happen to have to protect the right of people to make the decisions most affect them . who decides who is most affected ? the state of course . in other words , the more anarchists in society there are , the less likely gang rapists would be able to get away with it . if you 're going to say my kind '' of anarchists are n't going to protect the victim , then that 's just you defining yourself out of a solution . the point of spreading the memes of decentralized democracy is to fight lynchings and gang rapes if that 's not happening , then obviously you 're spreading the wrong memes . so if the world doesn t go according to your plan , it s because the individuals are at fault but not your plan ? if they did that , obviously it 's not democratic any more , is it ? since when was free trade between two individuals subject to the approval of others ? in individual freedom , there is no democracy , there is no mob rule , there is no collective enforcement of trade nor is there any enforced requirement to seek the approval from other individuals before one can engage in trade . if someone doesn t want to trade with another , then they shouldn t be forced to trade with them . an employer who pays a worker in exchange for their labor is a trade of money for labor . if either wants out of the trade , then that is their right . if you claim that firing workers is not democratic , then what about workers quitting ? should the employers find a way to force these workers to stay anyway ? why do you give the freedom to opt out of trades to only the workers , but not the employers ? your rights are not rights at all , but group privileges . that 's laughable . if a torturer earns x dollars , whereas the oppressed '' earns y dollars , is that a function of the supply and demand for wages of those types ? no , because whereas income is earned , meaning the giver of money willingly trades their money for the goods and services of others , a torturer on the other hand does not seek the voluntary cooperation of his victim . the victim does not willingly pay his money to the torturer . your analogy is complete garbage . no , it 's because those in power will only give more to those who are willing to keep them in power , while everyone else is screwed over . producers of goods and services have no power over anyone . their incomes depend on the choices that others make voluntarily . there is no power in free trade . the true source of power is the government , and it is required in order to create and maintain your ideal society . the same applies in corporations . shareholders are not going to be hiring a ceo that wants to overthrow shareholders and give control to employees . they would if the employees are able to earn the shareholders a higher return on their investment . in the same vein , the aristocracy is not going to be hiring torturers and generals that want to overthrow the aristocracy and give control to the general population . no , that is not the same vein . that is a totally different one where force is initiated . you are comparing apples and oranges . that life is more important than property . there is a scale of what things are more important if someone has to violate your property rights to live , then he deserves that right . if someone has to jaywalk to save the life of someone else , then antijaywalking laws must give way . if a rape victim needs to break your rake over the head a rapist , then she deserves that right . need never usurps rights .	c0gh4rd	Economics

as long as they say it now , they are correct . the same with anybody with an extreme ideology that never gets exactly implemented . it was , the results were just so horrible that they deny it ever occurred . some would say the same about capitalism , that it 's been tried and failed . you claim we do n't have capitalism , but corporatism . then you claim that they had communism , when they would say it was fascism . then you 'd claim that communism leads to fascism and they 'd claim capitalism leads to corporatism . those socialists supported communism before the news broke that millions were being sent to gulag worker camps . so , you 're saying the socialists supported a group of people who they thought would implement their ideal , then when it turned out they were n't implementing it and doing horrible things , they decided to no longer support said group . sounds like the same thing which has happened with conservatives supporting republicans and liberals supporting democrats . so are you actually of the opinion that another 23 of government debt and spending would have solved the problem of too much debt and spending ? i never advocated any position , just cleared up what krugman 's was . he had a specific number in mind which they came up short of . it 's not like he called for 700 billion , that did n't work , so he 's calling for more , then if that does n't work call for more . he has set the bar and in his mind they came up very short . edit and way to completely over simplify the complex financial meltdown by comparing government debt and spending to private debt and spending . i 'm sure we can find a fallacy for that too . where did i make a straw man argument ? you erroneously made an argument that krugman is always calling for more spending and says that it 's never enough for him . he has quite specifically said how much he thinks needs to be done , so of course until they do that he 's going to think it 's not enough . if he called for 700 billion dollars , then when that did n't work called for more you 'd be correct . but what actually did was say it should be about 2 trillion , and most likely to appease centrists they 'd make it quite a bit smaller , then when the time came and they realized they needed more it 'd be a lot harder to get another bill through , which is exactly what has happened . oh , and the straw man part . instead of actually arguing against the points made , you made a general and false argument on why krugman and keynesians are calling for more spending . actually , i 'm not sure if that 's a straw man , ad hominem , or whatever the fallacydujour is , but it certainly was n't arguing the points .	c0asbxx	Economics

about 10 years ago , when i was working in frankfurt , germany s banking capital , i was invited to the top floor of the glittering skyscraper headquarters of one of the country s most venerable banks . there , i was treated to something that , it was made clear to me , few eyes usually had the privilege of seeing a tour of its private art collection , an impressive spattering of modern and ancient european and american masters . the point was , those pictures reflected the bank s wealth . and the fact the secretive treasures were kept forever behind closed doors for the enjoyment of the privileged few reflected its power . if that seems like a different era , it is . banks around the world are reeling , as we know the european banks losses are among the most ruinous . and their prestige and putative secrecy and independence received a further blow last week , when the government of switzerland agreed to release to the united states the names of 4,450 american citizens suspected of using secret swiss accounts at ubs , the country s biggest bank , for tax evasion . the victory for the united states was made possible by evidence from an americanborn whistleblower code name tarantula a disgruntled former ubs employee from the boston area who was working in switzerland . until he left the bank , he was part of a ubs team that made frequent trips across the atlantic to aggressively market investment strategies to rich americans to elude the scrutiny of the internal revenue service . but it would be wrong to see the settlement as a oneoff strike against just one bank by a single government . it is in fact the result of a broader political moment created in the wake of the global financial crisis when disenchantment with financial globalization is causing governments to repatriate wealth back to within national borders , especially at a time when countries badly need to balance their books . just a few years ago , in the precrisis era , the shadowy workings of crossborder banking and what may or may not have been happening there were generally overlooked . and , while some of the alleged tax evaders may be the war criminals , gunrunners or despots usually linked with secret foreign bank accounts , the target of the latest efforts are much more likely to include rich businessmen and highnetworth individuals . there is a political movement because of the financial debacle , said one veteran european banker who insisted on speaking anonymously because he has retired . they are turning toward the socalled rich and want to hurt them. of course , the united states looks at it a bit differently . prosecutors have contended that in the ubs case alone , wealthy americans hid billions of dollars , thereby evading taxes of hundreds of millions of dollars a year . while switzerland is arguably the largest offshore center , it is not the only one . supporters of its banking secrecy code point out that the code is wrapped up in the country s claims to neutrality and being above the global political fray . but secrecy has also turned out to be immensely lucrative according to some estimates onequarter of the world s offshore money now resides in switzerland . other countries or territories have copied the model liechtenstein , bermuda , the cayman islands , macao and hong kong among them . and while switzerland is probably seen as the most conservative , blue chip , upstanding offshore haven , the others are measured by a sliding scale of probity and association with dubious business practices , if not crime . the european banker said that in the early 1990s , following the fall of the soviet union , he worked in switzerland where he said agents of russian expats would show up with boxes of cash from cyprus , a popular haven for capital fleeing the russian authorities and the country s postcollapse chaos . the backlash against this illicit world has not been confined to the united states it is apparent across europe , too . france will become of one of the first european countries to put in place a new tax treaty with switzerland to improve transparency and access to banking information . germany is in discussions with liechtenstein over issues related to tax evasion by german companies and individuals . liechtenstein has also struck a disclosure agreement with britain , encouraging british clients of liechtenstein banks to volunteer information to british tax authorities in return for reduced penalties . in italy , tax officials have started an investigation into whether the estate of the late gianni agnelli , the former chairman of fiat , has money hidden away in switzerland . in britain , the government has become particularly exercised by tax competition the offering of low tax rates and other advantages like tax secrecy to lure capital away . in the swiss settlement last week , the american authorities got the information they needed after they saw an opportunity in the weakness of ubs , a bank that once enjoyed a sterling global reputation but has suffered billions of dollars in losses linked to united states subprime securities and had to be saved by a big government bailout last october . for the swiss government , the deal lifts the immediate threat of heftier legal action and frees the bank one of the mainstays of the swiss economy to concentrate on recovery . but will anything really change ? although the united states is supposed to learn the identities of a few thousand tax evaders , those names will go first to an intermediate tax administration in switzerland for review . the actual process of recovering the names may become lost in bureaucracy and footdragging . moreover , as the times reported last week , smaller swiss banks say they are confident that they can continue to profit by finding new , more elaborate ways to protect the privacy of their clients . those banks continue to help clients hide billions of dollars through complex structures in offshore havens . but the i.r.s . commissioner , doug schulman , said the agreement with ubs was a major step forward in the government s efforts to pierce bank secrecy , and he warned that wealthy americans who have hidden their money offshore will find themselves in a jam. in the new political climate , expect to see a few rich americans shifting

i worked around baby boomers as a gen x guy and i think their reputation is well deserved . they were more than willing to talk about working hard etc ... but were always gone friday afternoons . the things that ca n't be disputed are the results of various policies implemented while a particular generation had political sway and what we have is ungodly debt , wars started on lies , evaporated job markets due to questionable corporate tax policies , etc . my view of the older generation 's 'hard work ' is that they showed up on time , stayed late a few nights , had the benefits of robust labor laws , and relatively good job security until recent . my own experience is this i went through ten layoffs in my first ten years of my career . i did n't get laid off during those ten years . i must have seen 3040 people lose their jobs . i worked hard and kept my head down . eventually i did get laid off because my baby boomer manager wanted my position . i loved the guy ... but he would come walking in at 10 am carrying a camera . again , he talked like he was a hard worker ... but he really was n't . my point is that i worked hard and saw my standard of living whittled away . not because of my 'slacking ' generation was too lazy to earn the rewards but because jobs were being outsourced overseas . in essence , our generation was exposed to relentless attacks to our standard of living because of policies . however , the baby boomers came of age when working hard was generally rewarded they did n't have to compete with someone in india , china , or malaysia . their only competition for jobs was local . so yea , i think the baby boomers are a bunch of loud mouths who think they worked hard for their rewards . but the reality is that they came of age during progressive policies that sheltered them from the harshness of the markets and a military machine that ruthlessly dictated american interests in the world . now , after twenty years of baby boomer driven politics that eliminated the social shelters they grew up in , we are in debt at the highest percentage since wwii , unemployment is incredibly high , see a financial crisis that was borne of greed not only of wall street but middle aged baby boomers wanted to maximize their 401k , labor laws are whittled to nothing , and we have yet another war based on lies . this can all be attributable to the values of the baby boomer generation . edit btw , your generation did plenty of bitching about volcker .	c0nkcum	Economics

the major reason is the push that a degree should be affordable for everyone '' . it 's great rhetoric to hear from politicians , but it comes at a cost . if the school gives the student from a poor family with seven kids free tuition , the money to run the school must come from elsewhere . tuition rates for everyone else are raised . the very rich can still afford it , but the middle class '' of students parents are teachers , service workers , or government workers ca n't afford it without going into huge debt . schools make this debt readily available to students , who do n't understand that it is n't free money . they just know they do n't have to pay anything right now . the average college freshman does n't truly understand that he or she is going into 100k of debt to get a degree in english that may earn them a marginal 60k .	c0qnxkb	Economics
this is mostly false nonsense propogated by libertarians who do n't understand that professional sports teams and their accompanying stadiums are a huge way to bring in amazing amounts of nonlocal revenue . the problem , is politics gets in the way of the smart things that cities need to do besides writing a blank check . if done properly , the city can encourage and assist in the development or redevelopment of the area around these new stadiums . if the city insists on putting new stadiums in areas that are n't exactly fleshed out so they can get a lot more construction and development going , they can pay for themselves relatively easily . the idea is to create a viable neighborhood , not just build a stadium . when you just build a new stadium in the parking lot of an old stadium , you do n't do much for the local economy . you do n't encourage new business , you do n't encourage new residential , you do n't really do much of anything . this is the crucial point where most cities fuck it up and do n't recoup the cost they invest in the team . around here , oakland could really revitalize a part of oakland if they 'd get the sack to build a new baseball stadium somewhere that people would like to be . the one they have right now has absolutely nothing around it except another stadium and a huge parking lot . that 's good and all , but an open , empty parking lot does nothing for the local economy . contrasted with the new sf ballpark and there are milliondollar condos and apartments , a ton of restaurants and sooner or later a hotel or two in a place where there was literally nothing but industrial shops and warehouses before the stadium came along . it was cheap space that most people were n't interested in on a crappy side of the bay . now it 's an affluent touristfriendly zone in an otherwise sorta crappy neighborhood that is slowly turning into something pretty nice . none of this would have happened without a baseball park . cities can wish and hope all they want , but without some major attraction somewhere , dead zones in a city are n't going to fix themselves . stadiums help a lot more than most people want to realize , especially the i hate sports , so sports do n't help me '' people who fail to look beyond the immediate impact of a stadium . but , they get the good end of the arguments when terribly run cities make poor examples of what not to do when building a halfbillion dollar stadium for sports teams . yes i 'm looking at you cincinnati and st. louis who failed to do anything at all when putting a new stadium in the ashes of the old stadiums and basically wasting any chance the city had of encouraging new development anywhere in the city	c0ik3ue	Economics

appreciation in real estate is a function of scarcity . if you buy in the correct locations your property should appreciate because it is desirable and there are limited quantities available . while i do agree with supply and demand , this is not always the case . for example , there is an area of columbus , ohio called upper arlington . it is essnetially rows of 1920s era houses , about 1000 to 1500 sq ft costing around 350,000 to 400,000 . columbus surrounds this city so it can not expand , which is the official excuse for the homes being overpriced . during the 1980s , this area was not one of the best and some people starting coming in , buying up lots of houses , tearing some down in order to beef up the prices in the area . now you have a sizable area of overpriced homes that only the wealthy can afford , and this was done by design . upper arlington can be considered , not quite upper end rich , but definitely upper middle class . you have to go to dublin and bexley if you want rich homes . i think you just proved his point .	c0jsv9n	Economics

to give a very brief answer to this critique of the ltv a famous response to that theory is diamond why diamond worth so much if one finds a diamond on the ground effortlessly marx said that the value of something was found in essentially the average labor time of production of the entire industry , not in the labor of a given instance of production what marx says about diamonds diamonds are of very rare occurrence on the earth s surface , and hence their discovery costs , on an average , a great deal of labour time . consequently much labour is represented in a small compass . jacob doubts whether gold has ever been paid for at its full value . this applies still more to diamonds . according to eschwege , the total produce of the brazilian diamond mines for the eighty years , ending in 1823 , had not realised the price of oneandahalf years average produce of the sugar and coffee plantations of the same country , although the diamonds cost much more labour , and therefore represented more value . with richer mines , the same quantity of labour would embody itself in more diamonds , and their value would fall . if we could succeed at a small expenditure of labour , in converting carbon into diamonds , their value might fall below that of bricks	c1ae79p	Economics
yes , but it does n't matter to them because the fdic insures their deposit 's nominal value . if there were no federal reserve system and no fdic , then banks would be taking on far greater risk in loaning out depositor funds , and so they 'd do less of it , and if they did n't they 'd lost customer trust because customers would n't give banks their money if they had legitimate fear the money might be lost . nobody bothers to read those contracts you reference precisely because the accounts are fdicinsured . otherwise we 'd be good , skeptical consumers asking tough questions about what the bank intended to do to protect our money . and the banks that failed in this capacity would have serious problems . now , in practice , what would probably happen is that there would be private insurers providing insurance coverage to the banks , and customers would seek out banks that are insured by known reputable companies . but absent a federal reserve system , you can be damn sure such private insurers would not provide depositholder insurance to banks that were loaning out 90 of deposits !	c143lwj	Economics

popper would actually be appalled by what is called science today . today 's use of the word science is a greatly watered down version championed by thomas kuhn of the more rigorous and demanding philosophy of popper . '' i do n't know exactly what you mean by that , but most scientists never really cared for popper 's notion of science '' in its full rigor . modern scientists take a more bayesian approach , which involves both induction and empiricism . popper 's philosophy was at odds with both quantum mechanics and darwinian evolution . guess who won that battle ?	c14efdk	Economics

you realize they still drive under the priorities enforced by the government , instilled by the yield signs ? what you see here absolutely does not suggest a conclusion that traffic lights are a bad idea to regulate traffic , but rather that inefficient network optimization of the traffic lights schedule can lead to huge congestion , and of course any faults that serve as bottlenecks are pretty selfenforcing until the traffic comes to another congested stable equilibrium flow . this can easily be fixed by some optimization . also , this is a joke of a junction , so it is a good candidate for just having yield signs regulate its traffic . try this on some major artery roads where cars are flying with 80120 kmh , see if it works .	c11n77t	Economics

question if krugman wanted a bubble '' , using and meaning those exact words , then why did he call for action in 2005 when it was clear that the housing market was in , and i quote the exact term he used , a bubble '' ? that 's not my question . my question is , if krugman called for action in 2005 to end a housing bubble , then why through 200102 did he call eight times for the creation of a boom publicly in order to stimulate the economy . the reason why krugman 's prediction '' of the housing bubble is bunk is because he agitated for its creation in the first place . go back up and reread the quotes it 's there . krugman is representative of a fallacious economic theory that teaches there should be intervention in the economy . well , the problem with this is that intervention requires further intervention , as can be seen by krugman 's back and forth stance with housing booms . it was n't that krugman just called for a interest rate cut in 2001 it 's that he called for an interest rate cut for the specific purpose of creating artificial demand for housing . however , bubbles do not have to go hand in hand with economic drivers . it 's perfectly valid for a housing boom to stimulate the economy ... if houses are actually needed , and of benefit to people who genuinely need to buy them and are willing and capable of getting them at the market price . and that 's perfectly excellent that the market can have real growth through bubbles in certain areas . austrians do n't believe that 's a bad thing for there to be economic growth . what austrians believe is a bad thing is when bubbles are artificially created in certain areas through credit expansion and regulatory prodding . murray rothbard calls this a cluster of failures '' when thousands of investors , acting independently of one another , all make the same mistake . there had to be something about the investment , not the investors , that made so many people make the same error . that can be seen in speculative bubbles throughout history , and almost always governments are central figures in the creation of bubbles .	c0k1h22	Economics

it 's directly related to he ascendancy of the credit card industry . prior to delaware loosening banking rules to allow delawarebased banks to a extend credit anywhere in the nation b charge interest rates typically classified as usury there was no profit in smallscale consumer lending . if you needed to buy a fridge , for example , your bank extended you a small loan . imagine doing that nowadays ... so the existence of smallscale consumer loans being tied , preapproved , to a thing in your wallet replaced the notion of money being in the bank and any extensions to that money needing to be approved by a man on the other side of the desk . it did wonders for the economy of delaware . nevada soon followed . then banks lobbied every state legislature and whined about th fact that they could n't compete with out of state banks and usury '' became a funny term from the bible , rather than a component of the criminal code . as soon as we were used to having 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 thousand dollars o preapproved credit at 10 or 20 interest he banks would do anything they could to extend credit ... after all , that 's where thy make their money . the housing bubble in particular is directly related to the repeal of glasssteagall in 1999 , which took down the wall between thrift '' and investment '' for financial institutions glasssteagall forbid banks from playing in the stock and bond markets and the creation of the collateralized debt obligation cdo which allowed banks to profit on the statistical likelihood of a group o mortgages not being repaid . and , since the returns were better on risky mortgages than stable ones , these banks had a steep financial incentive to lend money to people who could never pay it back . i 'm mobile today or i 'd link more . frontline has a great episode on credit cards from 2003 or 2004 pbs.org . i also recommend the books iou '' and the big short .

i think you misunderstand what the bailout actually did . it provided a short term liquidity to the banking sector in the absence of interbank lending and provided a facility for the banks to unload illiquid mbs paper at distressed prices . why do you oppose banks being given access to emergency credit and liquidity facilities if these facilities allow their continued functioning once volatility had died down ? the banks were given this access because if all american banks are forced to liquidate , the prices of all their holdings will plummet as foreign investors simply can not take up those asset volumes . the crashing prices of those assets affects the markets at large , which destroys the value of pensions of millions of middle class americans . in short the choice was either to help the banks through a period of liquidity problems and preserve the stored value of those pensions , or force the banks to deal with the problems without an expansion of the money supply , probably causing most of them to default and in the process destroy the life savings of millions of americans . do you really think it is worth 'showing the bankers what for ' at the expense of everyone 's pension fund ? what we need to do is learn from the experience and make regulatory amendments so that we do n't have a repeat performance . the first thing that needs to happen is that a glasssteagal equivalent needs to be passed which prohibits banking , insurance and brokertrading services being offered by the same company , or by its subsidiaries or even within an umbrella corporation . there also needs to be a movement to regulate the cds market , as well as take another look at the methods via which capital adequacy requirements for banks are formulated .	c0llqhc	Economics

rather than argue your case like an educated person , i 'm just going to give my heavily biased situational experience . while i was living in chicago , the main arteries into and out of the city were the interstate highways . you literally could not get to the northwest suburbs without using the interstate highways , unless you wanted to get stuck in traffic lights for an hour . seeing this , the city of chicago decided to put a toll at the outskirts of the city , right where the exit of the airport is . the end result is that traffic is backed up in both directions for miles . i 've timed it multiple days , and it usually takes me 20 minutes to go the 2 mile stretch right before the toll ... and that 's not even during rush hour . mind you that this is on an interstate highway where the average speed in 80 mph ... unless you 're near that toll . of course we citizens bitched about it . so instead of removing the toll like we demanded , they decided to reinvest '' in the infrastructure ... not by adding new lanes or making different routes ... instead , they demonstrate they 're spending the money by paving the roads . roads that were paved no less than a year ago . roads that are now paved every year . how do they pave the roads ? one lane at a time , which means that now , not only is traffic backed up due to the toll , but it 's also backed up because everyone has to merge due to a lane closure and people in chicago do n't know how to drive , but that 's a rant for a different day . why is there a toll on this interstate highway ? rarely do i see federal highways being tolled , especially a major artery that literally cuts through chicago . and why are they paving the roads every year ? i 'm not an expert , but i 'm pretty sure if you do it right the first time , it lasts for decades . sorry , this turned out less of a discussion about public works and more about how retarded the chicago department of transportation is ...	c18fb1z	Economics
also diminishes the return on savings for lenders who have smaller profits . pensioners and retirees tend to fall into this population which then decreases the value of savings and thus the incentive to save and conversely increases the reliance upon governmental entitlement '' payments . thus creating a retirement population that is politically bound '' to politicians hence the do n't cut my soc secmedicare '' mantra . and also do n't forget that any interest gains are then also taxed as income and if the inflation is high enough , it entirely eats up '' any real interest gains , so that the subsequent principal balance ends up decreasing in real value over time something that is only partially counteracted or compensated for by the increasing technological and productivity advances lowering the cost of some goods . the whole point of inflation under a fiat monetary system is to achieve the same end as any other form of currency debasement namely to act as a hidden form of taxation and to siphon off increasing larger portions of the wealth '' coming from the technology and productivity gains and to redirect it via deficits through the expenditures of the various governmental bureaucracies .	c12czcd	Economics
it is about the contract between the bank and the account holders . there would be accounts that only safeguards money , pays zero interest , and charges some fee . other accounts would be investment accounts . those would pay a share of the profits of the investments , but would be risky , and the money could not be withdrawn at any moment . in that case , the bank would be a distributor or broker of capital . of course , a whole rainbow of derived services would also be available , as we have the freedom of contract . for example the current fractional reserve system could possibly survive in an honest system , provided that the contract clearly says that in the unlikely event of massive failure of investments made by the bank , the account holders might not be able to get all money back .	c0lrk1l	Economics

that is one of the many effects in a static world . other countries will be forced to follow suit because of the reserve currency status . this tinkering has many other deleterious effects as well . monetary inflation is a guarantee by definition . overall price inflation '' or increase in cpi is what is not guaranteed to occur , although commodities price will continue to rise nominally to offset the monetary inflation . i understand that this is what the fed is trying to accomplish . however monetizing debt by buying your own bonds to artificially drive down interest rates is a fools errand and in lock step with the mentality that got us in this mess in the first place . artificially low interest rates cause major distortions in the market that can not be magically healed by the resetting of interest rates or by financial trickery at the fed . the ultra low interest rates after the dot com bust have proven to be the catalyst for our current recession . the fed tried to solve the problem by raising rates in 0506 but this failed . what makes you think another bout of low interest rates will be successful this time ? savers and investors get hurt with a weak dollar policy and monetary inflation . low interest rates mean that savers have to chase riskier assets to beat inflation and get a reasonable return for retirement . this helped wipe out a significant portion of the middle classes savings recently . you already know this but you expect me to swallow your disproven theory that if we make it cheap to borrow more money again cash on hand is at record level for american businesses is the way to get the economy back on track . what we need is for asset prices specifically housing to come down to a reasonable levels based on incomes and for a rise in long term interest rates so we can begin rebuilding our savings as a nation . economic prosperity comes from savings and investment which turns to production . as evidenced by the us , japan , germany and china in past 100 years . more importantly the fed cant continue to paper over the excess of our government and its run away spending . this has got to stop at some point and it would rather now then when the problem becomes even worse .	c1553c1	Economics

the economy will only get worse . i could get into specifics , but in general , firms have little incentive to hire , and unemployment is the biggest longterm threat to the economy right now . as long as firms do n't hire , and they do n't seem to be , there is no recovery . corporate profits are great , but relatively meaningless when the vast majority of people do not benefit from billions of dollars in profits that are mostly saved by the corporations themselves and are not even taxed . until the people themselves actually start seeing benefit from the recovery , then in my mind the recovery does not exist . and reemploying an undereducated populace that clings to exceptionalism and an unsustainably high standard of living is no easy feat . the sheer restructuring that needed to happen after the debtfueled spending frenzy of the mid 00 's is mindblowing enough , and now we need to adjust to that during a deep recession following a financial crisis . i 'm not sure the world has ever seen an economy in such a strange and precarious place as the us economy , and there 's no easy way out . i hate to be the pessimist , but the prospects for the us economy are not good .	c0xk8so	Economics

i 'm not sure this is a valid analogy . i have seen this kind of explanation used before , and i think it simplifies the context too much . a political society is very different from a free corporate society . the critical difference is that a political society , ultimately , is based on the use of force by one group of people to arrogate to themselves some part of the earnings of society . conversely , a corporate society a legal one , must try to persuade , through voluntary means , others to give them goods or services in trade for other goods of services . obviously there are times when businesses use force , but this is far from the norm , and the purpose of political society is to act as the final arbiter in preventing such behavior . a political society , on the other hand , rarely if ever uses voluntary trade as the basis for its interaction . you occasionally get redistributive services social security , medicare , etc which are the takings from one group to give to another , and you occasionally get some poorly managed voluntary services amtrak , postal service , roads , public education .	c0vrr1b	Economics
this is indeed too simplistic but not because of inflation . as you mention real growth is below the one shown but mostly by a fixed fraction . real gdp growth is 2 instead of the 3.3 nominal shown here . real s p500 growth is thus lower as well . that just changes the slopes and exponents of the curves but does n't change the final conclusion . in fact the final graph should be insensitive to that and that was the important one , the rest is just justification . redoing the math using the cpi to adjust for inflation would be interesting . i should probably publish the spreadsheet together with the article so people can play with those kinds of things .	c0r2wso	Economics

1937 was also when the massive new taxes to support the social security administration were rolled out , and of course gdp is going to shrink when government decreases spending . using the keynesian national accounting identity y c i g nx , if one variable goes down and the others stay constant ... duh . but , beyond that , markets take time to adjust even keynes realized that , which is why his concept of stickiness is n't too far off the mark . how do the lessons of 1937 '' apply to the recession of 194647 , when government spending fell , there was a minor recession , and very soon everything picked up as capital was allowed to be readjusted from producing war machines to producing real capital goods . if what you take for gospel was actually true , there should have been no recovery when the united states decreased government spending there was . moreover , as a comparison , great britain left their economy more or less nationalized for decades after wwii , created a huge social burden with the nih , and they stagnated until the 1980s . your theory of the economic recovery is henceforth refuted . try again , gonzo . the problem with keynes , krugman , the new deal , and interventionist economic policy is that they do n't understand the concept of capital formation or how economic activity is planned across time . higher order production like stores and factories takes time to build , and this requires saved capital . this means people need to save and delay consumption so that firms can correctly predict the best way to allocate means of production and hiring . by artificially stimulating consumption , it creates an unsustainable time preference for consumption in the present , discourages saving , and ultimately leads to a boom that will collapse in short order . folks that laud the new deal always forget that real capital investment the i in the keynesian national accounting identity , for those of you so inclined did n't return to 1929 levels until 1941 this is perfectly understandable if you keep in mind that excess liquidity causes the preference of individuals to consume to increase , and the preference for businesses to invest to decrease .	c0jgsrk	Economics

i to can frame a leading question should we blame the commercial banks from making loans as the cause of the depression when the central bank 's tightening of monetary policy and strict adherence to maintain the gold standard to maintain the purchasing power of the dollar are to blame ? the fed engaged in qe of the time , correct , but it did not injected enough to keep the m2 aggregate from falling severely , friedman and shwartz showed us this . friedman also had this to say about the stance of interest rates and monetary policy low interest rates are generally a sign that money has been tight , as in japan high interest rates , that money has been easy . after the u.s. experience during the great depression , and after inflation and rising interest rates in the 1970s and disinflation and falling interest rates in the 1980s , i thought the fallacy of identifying tight money with high interest rates and easy money with low interest rates was dead . apparently , old fallacies never die . the fed did n't cause the recession that occured starting in mid 1929 , it caused the depression that followed . but we do n't have to take just a crazy monetarist view of it , here is hayek however , an important and often overlooked exception to hayek s doctrine is mentioned in one paragraph and is quite relevant to the situation in the early 1930s . that exception concerned the assumption that the velocity of money was constant . a change in velocity , hayek 1931 , 107 noted , has rightly always been considered as equivalent to a change in the amount of money in circulation. while he was not particularly enamoured with the concept of velocity , it will serve as sufficient justification of the general statement that any change in the velocity of circulation would have to be compensated by a reciprocal change in the amount of money in circulation if money is to remain neutral towards prices. thus , hayek essentially conceded that the money supply would have to be adjusted to offset fluctuations in velocity . however , in this work he did not stress the importance of this exception and hence he left everyone with the impression that no action should be taken to counter the deflation .	c2ysnvy	Economics

your argument was that they prolong poor economic situations . could i get a permalink of where i said that..thanks sorry that was my fault . you are correct in stating that the fed does n't provide a disincentive for banks taking on risk . please provide the argument . stated right after the partial quote you cited ... further expanded argument volatility is basically the fluctuation of prices . massive price swings like those seen in boomsbusts are fluctuations in prices . volatility is generally caused by risk ie debt exposure which is what you stated the fed encourages . therefore boom and busts have higher probabilities of happening , and if the probability goes up naturally the frequency of both goes up . as far as the fed causing boombusts ... while they do n't disincentive high risk practices which increases the potential for a boom or bust , the boom and bust cycle is a natural part of economics and they have occurred long before the fed existed and even before the usa existed for that matter . if the housing bubble did n't happen , i can almost promise you that there would have been one somewhere else . its impossible to avoid busts as much as some people dislike them . to stop busts , you would need to stop all transactions . that 's not going to happen .	c1lbw3m	Economics

my take is that krugman has been arguing that both qe1qe2 and tax cuts for the rich are not very effective . the reasons in general are banks are holding the new money as excess reserves to cover bad loans wealthy hold some tax cuts as excess reserves because of low rates of return , desired liquidity , or big spending has become unfashionable . wealthy invest some tax cuts into corporations that hold the money as excess reserves because there is less need for capitol expenditures when demand is low your take on krugman is more in line with the teachings of milton friedman . friedman was a monetarist where as keynesians tend more towards fiscal action . keynesians would argue the best use of borrowing in this situation would be to invest in things that have a roi like failing infrastructure , job training , or replacing our outdated electrical network .	c1ovmo6	Economics

it 's not a matter of liking '' or disliking , '' it 's still a broken window fallacy and adding in the engineers who design weapons , scientists who research them , manufacturers to make them , etc , that all just digs the lost opportunity cost deeper . to say that we need to spend so much money on war because the us is a war economy is the tail wagging the dog . if all those resources were , say , instead making virtual reality entertainment systems and paying some number of people to play them all day , you would be here saying not just the people who use the headsets vrcorps , the engineers who design the vr systems , scientists who research them , tons of manufacturers to make them , secretaries and other office people to run the business , lobbyists and other washington personell to secure more and more funding . you may not like it , but the us is a virtual reality entertainment economy , vr sim is our thing . that 's just with making the blind stupid authoritarian idea of replacing the department of defense with the department of virtual entertainment . if we actually opened up these human resources to the market , we might actually be able to make something efficient . it led us out of the depression and made us the world power we are today . this feeling is probably the most egregious misuse of the false idea that correlation implies causation . yes , we happened to have a war after the depression , and we happened to come out of the depression after that war . but maybe , just maybe we would have come out of it even sooner without the war . or maybe there were other factors like all of europe being offline and our factories running strong . let me tell you about a psychological phenomenon called superstition . psychologists noticed that sometimes when they have a rat push a bar to get some food , they coincidentally have another behavior added . for example , the first time they push the bar , they might be lifting their back left leg . well , after that , this rat will always lift their back left leg while pushing the bar to get their food . even though lifting their leg has nothing to do with the barfood mechanism , and even though lifting their leg expends more energy , they continue to do it . if you introduce an amount of randomness the does not always give food , but food only comes from a bar press then these rats develop these superstitions more quickly and hold onto them much longer . well , let me tell you something , throughout all of our monetary history we have had problems with the boombust cycle . we would try tons of different things to ward it off and when that failed to quicken recovery . when this happened , it somehow got ingrained in our collective consciousness that this is the way out of depression and to economic prosperity . but the truth is , that it 's just us lifting our left back leg . there are some legitimate reasons why defense can lead to economic recovery . there are scientific advances that come from it . world war 2 not only ramped up our industrial capacity , but also got us to create efficiencies in energy . but 1 we then gave that industrial capacity and advances in energy to the private sector to create industry and 2 it 's hard to know if we would n't have built it up anyway if we had never been involved in the war and the outcome of the war was the same germany defeated , europe in ruins , as the demand for industry could have still pushed us in the same way . so , yeah , i know we have a problem with shoveling money at a part of the economy that usually gives little in return . but because of this one thing , the people in power will just keep on lifting that back leg until we are too tired and fall over .	c1jeuzs	Economics

'' i do n't need to look at any historical data over time to know that this proposition is definitely true . it follows logically from the existence of action . now , what the austrian will not do , which the mainstream thinks it can do , is predict what good and what unit will become the most highly valued and the least highly valued . we do not consider ourselves to have this ability that mainstream astrologers consider themselves to have . you 're argument reflects the connotations used by bible belt babies arguing against things like global warming when a simple biology 103 discusses how pollution can alter the environment . huh ? but hey , follow your faith like the earth was made 4,000 years ago . wut . you are one hell of an economic astrologer . u mad ? i am christian , but ignorance is ignorance . yeah , u mad .	c1uzavs	Economics

only on some income , as far as i 'm aware . and why would n't you ? a lot of libertarians conceive of governments as some sort of regional totalitarianism , but it 's really servicebased , which is why you can seek recourse with the american government basically anywhere in the world . i only view governments as taking on a totaliarian nature when they begin to intervene in the economy in sectors that do n't require coercion to be financed , and when they start initiating aggression on individuals in order to transfer wealth to another individual as a subsidy . i 'd also like for local government to be fully funded by local taxation . i think it only right for government to tax the production that goes on within its borders because they 're providing you with the freedom to do that production . i do n't see them as having a claim on any production that occurs outside of their borders . as for the citizenship bit , i 'd agree if you 're planning on using your citizenship then you should have to be paying some tax , but then i do n't think it reasonable to tax someone once they renounce a nation 's citizenship and effectively say , i do n't want to live here anymore or ask for anymore of your government 's help '' . i find it very bad that in america one must pay an exit tax '' as they renounce their citizenship ... this further cements my thoughts that a government such as that views the people as its property . i find it ironic that whatever wealth one manages to accumulate while being taxed along the way , is then taxed yet again on your way out . i genuinely think that the american government believes the population that is easiest to govern is one that is poor , loaded with debt , and is in such an unfortunate condition that they do n't have the luxury of taking a moral stance on fighting against coercive wealth transfers . i think their government is doing a fairly good job of creating such a condition in america today , although they could do better in my opinion . i meant , to legally abuse the system , rather than illegally , in a largescale kind of way , i.e . monstrous , you have to be rich to buy yourself that kind of legislative loophole , or lawyer up enough to argue your way out of trouble . i do n't see that as abusing the system '' so much as having freedom . or rephrased , i see it as , you must be fairly well off if you want to be free '' . i can understand the resentment by those who are not as well off , but think it 's a horrendous solution '' to strive to have the wealthy suffer a life with a lack of freedom as the poor do , instead of striving to give the poor a life of freedom as the wealthy have ! that is an enormous difference ! i think this decade is going to be interesting as i will not be surprisd to find the cost of being able to hide one 's wealth from plunderers as going down substantially . realms like the internet , which provide a great deal of anonymity and protection from physical coercive force , i think are going to make the process even easier . i suspect as the cost goes further and further down , the only people that wo n't be effortlessly keeping their wealth from being plundered will be those who out of greed feel they are actually gaining '' by being plundered less than the plunder that is getting channeled their way .	c1gae4g	Economics

the article writer suffers the typical misunderstanding of how unemployment works . the assumption that those that are on unemployment are coasting from government stipend to government stipend fails to account for the fact that they must show proof of their jobseeking activities in order to be considered unemployed . another idea the writer fails to account for is the lengthy process of finding and getting a job . nowadays , the average jobseeker finds that it takes months to get a job since employers draw out the process with resumesifting , first interviews , callbacks , second interviews , callbacks , sometimes more series of interviews , more callbacks , etc . it often will take days , sometimes weeks in between each step .	c20946u	Economics

'' not sure what that means . where are you getting that from ? '' uhh , it was somewhere in the beginning of the twohour video you linked to me , i forgot where though ... you can ignore that part of my argument if neither of us can find where it was said byabout him . regarding gold investors like george soros and henry paulson have also insisted that gold is increasing in price , but they refer to it as a bubble , not an investment . they feel that the price is increasing through the herdlke behavior and constant infusions of money into the gold market of newer and more optimistic people , and as soon as gold becomes unpopular , the ones left holding the gold lose as demand and trading dries up . so here 's the million dollar question for you what is you opinion of the fair price for gold where if you invested in it you would sell it ? if ca n't increase forever , and there should to be some worth to it infinity does n't count . now , if it 's anything less than 3000 , you 're in a bit of a pickle , because there 's not a lot of upside , but a huge downside depending on when you bought in , and you do n't profit from gold until you sell it . your gold wo n't make you more gold , or mail you cash every month . so really , the gold you would be holding is a lump of metal that your are now x in the hole for while you wait for someone else to pay a higher price for it because they think it 's worth more than the current price . to compare , let 's take a relatively boring stock of a company like at t , which is now paying about 6 in dividends and has decent growth prospects and industry presence over the next several decades . if you invest about 100,000 in at t , you both get dividends every 3 months , and assuming about a 20 tax on them and commissions , it would only take you around 25 years to cover your initial investment with just the cash from dividends and the ability to sell the stock back into the market for the price that day . you can also buy put options , but we wo n't go there it 's generally assumed that the stock market as a whole increases around 7 per year , but even allowing for 3 yearly growth in your stock , after 25 years if you do n't feel like selling it beforehand you could sell it off for about 209,000 . this is done under the assumption that at t wo n't raise their dividends and grow at a slow and constant rate , which actually does n't happen . feel free to subtract some percent for taxes , but you should walk away with about 300,000 after your initial investment in a socalled blue chip '' stock , making about 3x your money on a conservative investment that pays you to hold onto it . to be fair , this is not a categorical promotion of stocks . there 's a remarkable sameness in situation between the dotcom bubble and the gold bubble right now , since people keep speculating higher and higher prices , yet there is little real material worth , profit , and return to show for it besides astronomical prices and the money from people entering the market who pay more and more to play the game . people forgot that prices were n't the worth of a company , just what the last person was willing to pay for their purchase . so , what do you think gold will be worth in 25 years ? will you hold on to it for that long ? assuming that it would beat the theoretical growth of the s p index and at least gain 8 in value every year , its going price at the end of 25 years from now would be around 11,000 per ounce , and you 'd only make money when you sold it . would anyone seriously pay for that ?	c2ptba7	Economics

in 50 years we 'll be able to look back at how wrong everything was handled and many economists will make their name writing books about it , but the pattern is already eerily similar to the 1930s , even if the details are different . we have n't had massive bank runs to accompany the bank failures and there has n't been a deflationary spiral because we have much better tools and understanding than existed then . but in 1937 , just when it seemed like things might be working again , austerity happened . taxes went up , spending went down , and the fed tightened the money supply . the depression resumed . while we know a lot more today about how money works , and how people interact with it , the fact is that politics can intervene and turn a situation that 's starting to look better into a big stinking pile of shit . and there 's nothing you can do about it . the overseers of whatever happens to the economy over the next couple years are already in place and the inertia is in the wrong direction . calling out the second sharp edge of the global economic crisis now is a year or more too late the choices have already been made . the next 6 months will be very interesting to watch as basically all the major players are facing disaster without some kind of deus ex machina . personally i 'd rather be seeing it from the comfort of 50 years of hindsight .	c20jr53	Economics

according to the methodology section , they only used gdp growth when richer data was unavailable '' for each country , we produce a set of estimates of mean per capita private consumption for the years 20052015. we do so by applying the economist intelligence unit s eiu historical , estimated and forecast growth rates of per capita private consumption national accounts data to the survey mean per capita consumption level for each country . for survey data taken from the wdi database , the mean consumption level is derived using the income distribution , the poverty headcount ratio and the poverty gap . the eiu provides private consumption growth data for 113 of our 119 countries up to 2011 , and for 46 of the largest economies up to 2014. where eiu private consumption growth data is not available , we use gdp per capita growth forecasts from the imf s world economic outlook weo database as a proxy for per capita private consumption growth . do your criticisms still apply given this specification ? furthermore , let me quote the final two paragraphs in their entirety '' we recognize that there is a longstanding and unresolved debate surrounding the inconsistencies between surveybased and national accountsbased estimates of mean consumption . given the lack of alternatives , we believe that growth in the national accounts mean is the best proximate for growth in the survey mean . the fact that the world bank uses growth in the national accounts mean in order to update its surveybased measures to a given reference year adds confidence to this assumption . in fact , the methodology we adopt is almost identical to that used by the world bank to update its official global poverty estimates this is why our 2005 estimate is very close to that of the bank . '' finally , it is worth stating that we acknowledge there are caveats to this methodologymost importantly the reliance on national accounts dataand want to be clear that we do not believe our approach should supplant that currently used in producing the world bank s official poverty count . when producing global poverty data there are unavoidable tradeoffs between timeliness and accuracy , and our results should be read with this in mind . this becomes more pertinent as we move further away from 2005 , as forecast national account data increasingly shape our overall results . given how dramatically the world has changed since the era captured in the most recent official figures , however , we believe this tradeoff is one worth making , and that our analysis provides a useful baseline for understanding the current state of poverty and its mediumterm outlook .	c1ebngl	Economics

ah , i see . personally , i do n't have any specific preference for or against centralized , decentralized or even nonexistent economic policy . the only thing i care about is that policy or lack thereof is based on a balanced weighing of the available evidence . sadly , the past century seems to indicate that political machinations make this all but impossible in both heavily regulated and relatively unregulated economies . i agree with your criticism of central economic planning . it has a tendency to be influenced far too heavily by politicians ' pursuit of power , populist politics and corporate lobbying . and that 's without even taking into consideration the baffling level of incompetence that is seen on virtually all levels of government . on the other hand , low levels of regulation and central planning come with their own set of problems . for starters , it is quite striking how deregulation and decentralization almost invariably involve removing those policies intended to benefit individual citizens , while leaving in place or even strengthening those intended to protect corporate interests . moreover , corporations often have a remarkable tendency to behave like young children , oblivious to the long term consequences of their actions and disregarding personal responsibility when it suits them . and then there is the issue of cognitive bias , messing the picture up even further . in centralized economies , individual cognitive bias leads to institutional distortions of perception . for example , in government agencies the tendency of people to conform to their peers suggests that an implicit consensus will arise even when a matter should be contentious . on the other hand , in decentralized economies , the effects of systemic bias tend to go unchecked entirely in the absence of mechanisms intended to correct for them . a good example of this problem is discrimination based on race or gender . programs designed to combat this are regularly ineffective , destructive or counterproductive , since they are often based on dogmatic adherence to the implicit consensus of what should work '' in the agencies that enforce them . on the other hand , without such programs systemic bias against certain groups goes unchecked , disadvantaging not just these groups but also the economy as a whole and those corporations that fall victim to systemic bias in their hiring practices . in the case of technological unemployment , all approaches i can think of have major downsides . government programs to address the problem are likely to be hugely inefficient or even destructive , but leaving it to the market is likely to result in the issue and any problems that result from it to be largely ignored . in my view , an ideal solution would be individuals and corporations voluntarily adapting , with the growth in wealth leading to most people choosing to work fewer hours while maintaining a good standard of living , and spending their free time on creative and entrepreneurial pursuits , as well as enjoyment of life in general . however , the free market is unlikely to achieve such a result , and any government policies intended to enforce it would almost certainly have disastrous results . so , what do i think should happen ? in truth , i have absolutely no idea . if you have any suggestions , whether free market based or government based , i 'll be glad to hear them .	c253uej	Economics

energy as well as pollution audits are extremely difficult to design , and are tremendously prone to bias . studies designed by proponents of ethanol generally show ethanol as being energy efficient , while opponents show the reverse . usually the dichotomy exists because costsbenefits are includedexcluded with sound '' logic by the investigator . the biggest cost in the production of ethanol is fuel . brazil might manage a positive energy production because it has sufficient solar energy to help with the production processes which consume vast quantities of energy such as distillation . the us does not . it must use fossil or other energy sources to distill the product . just one of many reasons why energy audits can show different inefficiencies . even when audits are conducted properly with all the caveats , conditions , assumptions , and data , the science editor ca n't include them in his mass media article even if he understands them . which given the scope of science he is supposed to cover is unlikely . his editor , is far more interested in whizbang or scientists baffled article with which to amuse his readers . another way to look at it is that the best proxy for energy contentutilization for nonlabor intensive materials is dollar cost . there are enormous governmental subsidies , enormous profits in the agriculturalindustrial complex , and a whole lot of political dealing going on . if ethanol was cheaper to produce than gasoline , why does it need the subsidies ?	c2g9nu4	Economics

well one of the incentives for oil companies to not '' say we have passed peak oil is because one of the number one statistics shareholders look at is whether or not oil companies are able to replace their reserves . most of the time you will see companies reporting that they have replaced 103 of their reserves or some percentage over 100 to show that they are continuing to find new resources . oil companies make money off of oil ... no oil , no opportunity for profit , no one invests in them . in the short term they might make some money , but its bad news bears if they start running out of the one commodity they make money on .	c1j3wl2	Economics
the private sector had to pay down their debts because the government blew a bubble passing out mortgages without due process collateral . the great enabler fed prints the money , government enables fannie and freddie actually pushes them to get loans out no matter what . i do n't want to pay for their largess . everyone has been hit hard but the public sector does n't want to feel the pain . who would ? but i 'm not going to foot the bill so they can have a free ride . unlike the private sector , i ca n't choose not to buy ... that is extortion . edit oh , and we will have japanese style deflation . dollar general was just bid on yesterday for billions . who in japan are making out very well ? dollar stores . deflation is happening now , monetary deflation . people paying down debts is exactly monetary deflation . the fed is scared shitless . sad part is , it was caused by the fed . let 's bet . i bet the fed will dish out qeiii just like japan keeps building bridges to nowhere . it wo n't work . we are in uncharted waters . if we do n't stop the spigot , it 'll just be a worse crash later . edit2 the government handouts of college loans has blown that bubble sky high as well . all of the college students should start thinking about being debt slaves with a college degree they ca n't use in an economy like this that may last for 10 or more years . we need 150,000 new private sector jobs a month to just to absorb the new people coming into the market . we are n't getting anything like that . i 've been watching things for awhile . it 's fucked up . edit 3 about edit2 , i say private sector with emphasis because for every public sector job created , it takes from the productive middle class ... they have to pay for it and they are broke . you can tax the top 1 but it 's not going to do anything . we need to all stop spending money we do n't have and cut where we can to get our houses in order . i always have so i 'm not in danger ... just pissed . never bought anew home , just a fixerupper , and never bought a new car always used ones and fix them myself . have put in two engines so far and 4 transmissions . i 'm in the tech industry ... anyone can do this . i 'm a nofreeride person . someone always has to pay .	c1h7yka	Economics
stable loss of value is flatly uninteresting in an unit of exchange . a currency is not an investment there is no reason or need to expect that a dollar bill you hold in your pocket keeps it 's value . the primary job of a currency is to act as an unit of exchange , something in which other things can be valued . if prices stably go up every year , everyone can plan for it , and use it to mark their prices . gold is an awful currency because it 's value goes up and down very erratically had we been on gold standard for the past year , there would absolutely have been disruption because people doing large purchases would have had to consider the price fluctuations of the currency in their purchasing decisions . this is the same reason hyperinflation is bad , but normal inflation is n't as long as you can measure changes in months and not hours , there is not much real effect on the economy . most fiat currencies target 24 inflation because it 's easier to make a currency stably lose value than it 's to keep it 's value as it is , mainly because it disincentivizes holding large stores of the currency , which could cause serious supply disruption if they were flooded on market simultaneously .	c1uzwjs	Economics

1 they may be private banks , but a lot of that money is tied up in pensions . folks just approaching retirement would loose a substantial sum of money saved up for their retirement . so you take money from people who had nothing to do with it future generations , and give it to people who knew they were taking a risk and would have reaped the rewards of that risk ? how is that fair ? 2 defaulting on those debts would make any future loans much more expensive the people will end up paying either way . this has already happened . nobody wants to lend to ireland , because until ireland defaults , there is a very high probability of a default in the near future . they 're prolonging the pain to avert the loss of some imaginary good reputation ireland nolonger has anyway . if ireland defaults then at least it can begin to rebuild its reputation . 3 should they default and go back to the drachma , their currency will sink like a stone and every foreign import from tvs to oil will suddenly get very expensive . well , i 'm talking about ireland , not greece the article is in the irish independent . having an extremely cheap currency has benefits too with respect to exports , which is why in a recession most countries seek to devalue their currencies .	c2nskcw	Economics

reserve ratios in western countries change but get always lower decade after decade , never the other way . yes but that is because central banks began to use interest rates as a way to enforce monetary policy . australia , for example , gave up on having a reserve ratio back in 1988 because the reserve bank committed itself to using interest rates . you need to understand that raising and lowering the reserve rate was an older way of monetary policy . since the 1970s the modern way to do it has been to use interest rates . anyway , the point i 'm trying to make is that commercial banks are subject to lending restrictions imposed on them by central banks . in the past this was the reserve ratio . at present it is interest rates . all i 'm suggesting is that the reserve ratio can be used again in order to prevent inflationary pressures caused by my money creation idea . so when i said the reality is that they have accepted it already and have accepted it for decades . , i am talking about lending restrictions in general , not the reserve rate in particular .	c2a2jut	Economics

gee , i wonder why they made a choice like that ? perhaps because the alternative from of default via mass inflation was worse ? which is why all nations with fiat currency defaults choose '' that route . to be more specific it came on the heels of having to break a dollar peg . which , again , comes back to reliance on reserves of a foreign currency . so the , well russia just made a political choice '' argument is weak weak , foolishly weak . i have the details of the situation to fall back on . details which support my position . i 'll let the facts speak for themselves as to weak '' . 1998 russian financial crisis URL at the time , russia employed a floating peg '' policy toward the ruble , meaning that the central bank decided that at any given time the rubletodollar or rurusd exchange rate would stay within a particular range . if the ruble threatened to devalue outside of that range or band '' , the central bank would intervene by spending foreign reserves to buy rubles . for instance , during the year prior before the crisis , the central bank aimed to maintain a band of 5.3 to 7.1 rurusd , meaning that it would buy rubles if the market exchange rate threatened to exceed 7.1 rubles per dollar . similarly , it would sell rubles if the market exchange rate threatened to drop below 5.3 . the inability of the russian government to implement a coherent set of economic reforms led to a severe erosion in investor confidence and a chain reaction that can be likened to a run on the central bank . investors fled the market by selling rubles and russian assets such as securities , which also put downward pressure on the ruble . this forced the central bank to spend its foreign reserves to defend russia 's currency , which in turn further eroded investor confidence and undermined the ruble . it is estimated that between 1 october 1997 and 17 august 1998 , the central bank expended approximately 27 billion of its u.s. dollar reserves to maintain the floating peg . it was later revealed that about 5 billion of the international loans provided by the world bank and international monetary fund were stolen upon the funds ' arrival in russia on the eve of the meltdown . so what do we have there . pegged to a foreign currency which they ran out of the russian government was basically in the same fix as argentina . russia made a political choice to default not just on their dollar obligations when breaking the peg but to shut down the whole system . greece never ran out of euros , not even close . greece actually has a good deal more income and wealth than a lot of countries that are paying the cost of its debt and of bailing it out . greece is still one of the richer countries in the world , near the top of the income and wealth rankings . greece ran into trouble with interest rates precisely because the euro is effectively a foreign currency for them . the ecb does n't reside within their sovereign authority and they have to go hat in hand to private markets to borrow . when mosler lost a fortune of client funds on the russia default , he actually said it was n't my fault , russia should have acted like a fiat currency country . lol ! ! russia acted exactly like a fiat currency country . rather than go with that , i 'll refer back to some of mosler 's actual comments on russia URL unidentified i have one question , can you explain the difference between what happened in argentina and what happened in russia ? because russia defaulted voluntarily on its domestic debt versus argentina had a problem with us dollar debt . 002935 warren mosler so if any of you have been to the fed , you know you start everything off with so. so what happened in russia he laughs was that they had a fixed exchange rate , the ruble was fixed at 645 to 1 , and they were borrowing dollars in order to keep it going because people were would rather have their dollars than a ruble . when you have a fixed exchange rate , the dynamic is , if you get paid in rubles , you have three choices you can do nothing , you can buy ruble securities , or you can cash them in for the reserve currency , which was dollars . so with a fixed exchange rate the treasury competes with the option to convert , and you see that all the time , and so with fixed exchange rates , the interest rates are actually controlled by the market . and so what happened in russia is as the treasury competed with the option to convert , interest rates went up and up and up , and finally they were paying 200 percent and there was no interest rate where people would rather have the rubles than the dollars and they ran out of reserves , couldn t borrow any , and defaulted on their conversion obligation . now , at that point in time , what most countries would do would be just to float the currency and say , okay , look , there are no more dollars for now and the ruble s floating and just keep the money the central bank operational . what they did in russia , when they ran out of dollars , they just turned out the lights and went home , shut off the computers , didn t open for up four months later . when they did open up , they went in through the hard drives , and sure enough , the ruble balances were still there , and they were they basically honored them . there was a little bit of restructuring , but nothing particularly serious on the interestrate side . and so it was a fixedexchangerate collapse , or blowup , and they just shut everything down . ... btw , another thing that is weak , weak , weak a sure sign of bottomquality crankery not even decent hackery is making the claim that the world 's top professionals in a field are wrong because they are so stupid they do n't understand something so simple that completely amateur bloggers and useneteers figure out for themselves to refute them . many economists disagree with each other . i guess that means the ones that do n't agree with your personal favored positions are all cranks . it 's a silly argument , stick to the facts .	c5sfsnw	Economics

companies selling goods and services is n't a bubble . that 's the real economy . when demand for goods and services draws in investment in jobs and fixed capital , that 's the real economy . it is not a real economy at all . if companies are selling nails to create a giant statue commissioned by the government , or build empty houses in the middle of a housing bubble , that is not a real economy '' . those sales are not going to contribute to increases in future productivity . i argue that 's not true . a government deficit spending in a currency it also issues is never constrained in such a fashion . this contradicts what we know about basic human psychology . people only lend to a government if they believe the money they will be paid back will be worth more than the money they give the government . this means they only lend to a government if the government has to make loan repayments that are worth more than what it received initially in the way of the loan . the government will have to get the funds to repay the loan by taxing the economy , so yes , the nation will have less disposable income , all other things being equal . the accumulated debt ... is private savings . of course it 's private savings . the point is , the government will have to tax the nation in order to make the loan repayments . the loan repayments are what make the government 's debts someone else 's private savings . if there was no loan repayments , the debt would not be private savings . it would just be a loss for the lender . the only time it is harmful is if a deficit exceeds the capacity of the economy to absorb it in the period when the money is spent . it 's harmful if 1 the cost of the loss of credit in the private sector from the private sector having the government borrow against its future earnings , and 2 the cost of the loan repayment exceeds the benefit of the spending that the loan enabled , which in my opinion , is almost always the case . as long as there is slack in real resources labor , energy , materials there is room to deficit spend without it being inflationary . i 've addressed this , and you are not addressing my counterpoint . whether it 's inflationary or not , any kind of economic activity spurred by government stimulus will divert capital that was already being employed for productive purposes 'productive purposes ' means activities that boost future productivity , to the stimulus activity , which does not contribute to future productivity .	c4s5kty	Economics

13 million in our nation of 320m means the entire 30 year wave was about 4 or arguably the smallest proportional immigration of any race . and , with the tide officially at 0 net movement , it starts to become a moot point. why do you continue to ignore legal immigration despite my numerous attempts to point out the calculation errors induced by your omission ? it suggests you are not open to examining the data , and instead are cherrypicking numbers to make a pr case . not only are there more than 13 million immigrants , but they 're concentrated in certain places . why do you think california 's economy is so much worse off than the rest of the country at the moment ? sounds like we 're pissing billions and billions away , at that point. i agree . mandatory jail time for any person that hires a person who is not legal to work in the united states . behind every single employed illegal is an american citizen breaking the law. agreed , wholeheartedly . but no , we demonize the illegals , refuse them any form of citizenship , scream bloody murder when they unfairly compete and distort our economy with their unregulated labor , and we ohsorarely are willing to turn our eyes to the true cause of it if there were n't any american citizens willing to employ an illegal immigrant , there would be no illegal immigrants. there 's a bit of a catch 22 situation . the poorer people get , the less they can afford . the less they can afford , the more likely they are to hire someone who charges less , illegal or not . the more poor people there are as a result of people paying less , the more demand for low cost labor . blaming impoverished immigrants for emigrating is like blaming grass for being green , to me. except grass does n't have a choice . immigrants can apply for legal residency . most do n't even try . the solutions are plentiful we just have one party who wo n't accept any solution at all . they piss themselves in anger when amnesty is brought up , but they 're quick to say 'no no no that 's not what we meant ' when presented with the option of hiring up a few hundred thousand soldiers to go door to door to round up the illegals . so we 're stuck with an unfair distortion to our economy. it 's a false dilemma . you do not have to legalize a crime , or send the military to go round up every criminal you can find . i disagree that the distortion could n't be absorbed into our economy . there are so many jobs they do that i see little demand from citizens those jobs are the result of uncontrolled immigration . americans will do any work for the right price . the problem is that they do n't want to do it for the price that immigrants will do it for . that 's the problem , and it illustrates my point perfectly . without a supply of immigrants to accept poverty wages , employers would have to yield to market pressure and raise the pay to increase demand for their jobs .	c4l5qhd	Economics

no , the argument is not that as individuals we need more debt . the problem is that individuals need to actually spend their money for a modern economy to function . the problem is not that we do n't have the available resources for our economy to function at this level , its that there is less spending . as krugman put it , your spending is my income , and my spending is your income . so if you dont spend i dont make money and cant spend so you dont make money and the problem perpetuates . now by following the path you would prefer to take , everyone would be hoarding cash and not spending money . this creates a huge issue even though people are trying to be more responsible . if everyone is saving all their money , none of it is circulating and businesses will not expand because there is no demand , likely they will do the opposite . these laid off workers now cant spend and demand falls even further . without any kind of government intervention deflation will also occur , which is pretty bad for anyone currently paying off debt since the value of their debt is getting higher and higher in real terms . its a vicious cycle that only gets perpetuated when government cuts spending , and puts more people out of work . government programs like schooling and infrastructure are absolutely essential for the long term success of our economy , and in a downturn if the feds try and keep a balanced budget its going to be devastating for these programs and the long term economy in general . people claim employment is so high because people dont have the right skills ... but they certainly arent going to acquire them if they do not get a decent education . i totally agree that we cant run huge deficits forever and no one on earth is claiming we should do that , right now however building up us debt is not going to be harmful since the interest rate is so excessively low the news of today is that they are getting even lower and considering inflation , people are pretty much paying the us government to keep their money safe . the government is not crowding out spending either since everyone is currently sitting on their money . krugman wrote an article related to the cause of recessions way back in '98 which i think is quite relevant . URL and also to reply to your final point , the economy may very well be contracting . but to blame that on keynesian policies isnt accurate . the 800 billion dollar stimulus package was peanuts . theres no way that could help an economy over a couple years that is annually 15 trillion . everything since then has been even more pathetic and now we 're moving towards austerity . your argument also doesnt take into account the fact that local and state spending has fallen rather quickly and offsets much of the federal government spending .	c4v2jv6	Economics

i tend to be extremely wary of monetarists and monetarism of all stripes . i think that ngdp futures may be a useful tool to add to the box to help decide policy . however as i understand it market monetarist to a greater or lesser degree believe in taking discretion out of monetary policy much as the friedmanite monetarists did . and to me that 's a designing in of a future crisis . if the goal of monetary policy is a policy which does not introduce instability to the real economy , then any autopilot policy , any conceivable autopilot policy , will fail that test . this is a fundamental difference in worldview that has to be reconciled . if the economy is fundamentally stable , and all instabilities are induced by government , then someone like friedman , the austrians , or the market monetarists would have a point . if the economy is fundamentally unstable , as keynesians believe , then any autopilot policy will induce instability , because it can not account for all real world events . and for that reason i can not be a monetarist . because ultimately the keynesians are right , the economy is fundamentally unstable , regardless of government actions . so not only am i not a monetarist , i am quite leery of them because i believe that at least in part they are working from false premises . i have other problems with monetarism as well . mainly that most of the models are closed economy models . and the us is anything but a closed economy .	c756sbj	Economics

any government with the power to tax has the power to auction things off '' . this should be especially clear in the us where special tax deductions are a popular way of rewarding special interest groups . indeed , these deductions are often supported by the very political groups which claim to want smaller government . i 'm sympathetic to the idea that government should be restricted from doing certain things . i believe such limits can be very helpful to fostering better societies . but such limits have to be clearly spelled out and enshrined in law . vague complaints about the bigness '' of government are too broad to have any useful effect . more often it 's simply a way for special interests to advantage themselves by fighting regulations that increase market efficiency .	c5yy8vz	Economics
hi , i do n't know your this is still an issue , or you are still looking for help , but if you are i hope this can be of some help . i would suggest setting a maximum and minimum price based on quantityactive user for certain goods say food , or other necessities that a character requires . basically the government controls this through trade . set different countries different distance away from your trade centre the cost of trade will be based on this . now each country can demand a specific type of good say one demands metal weapons , one demands jewellery , one demands food , etc . , so whatever your users have produced a surplus of will have to be traded to the country that demands it so you can reach some subsistence level of essential goods quantityactive users again . all nonessential good can free float in the economy where the market can set the price . this will lead to good and bad times for your economy , underproduction of essential good will result in a high price of food , as the government will only buy just enough '' food , and high price of non essential goods as the economy trades them away for food . meanwhile , if essential goods are overproduced food prices will hit the minimum and the gov't will trade away the surplus for nonessential goods which will lower the prices of them however , as there was originally under production , the price will still be high . if your economy produces the correct amount all prices will be lowish and your economy will be in a boom . as for information , basically there skill determine their how much they can produce , given each possible unknown set of environmental conditions or under perfect conditions , expected condition , or bad conditions . here , skill could be a multiplying factor and conditions should be set under some random continuum 0,1 , where 1 is perfect conditions , and 0 is some worst possible conditions that can not be reached , but can almost be reached . in order to keep enough essential resources in your economy , set some maximum level of that resource they are able to hold . best of luck with the game .	c4bop99	Economics
what was carter supposed to do ? ramp up us production enter into trade deals and pick off opec members one at a time make friends with saudi arabia what we did since probably a million other things that i 'm too lazy to come up with right now . p we made a deal with the devil to get oil out of the saudis . our interventionism and promonarchism created a host of other mideast enemies . and we lost allies in iran and syria and eventually iraq using the selfsame policies . us production has increased , but that does n't address the issue of peak oil , or secondary pollution concerns that have cost our nation billions . and the whole reason opec formed was because the nations realized they could get better deals collectively than one at a time . picking off opec nations had been western policy , until they got smart . then gas prices dropped again in the 90s yes , as a result of foreign policy wins with arab states during the 80 's and 90 's , and the implosion of the soviet union that opened up siberian energy supplies to the west . i 'm not sure what wins '' you are referring to . iran went completely to shit during the 80s and iraq got completely out of hand and invaded kuwait in '90 . these were n't wins at all . they were dismal failures . then there is the israelpalestine mess which has been the 'effing definition of failure for the last 60 years . our meddling in the middle east has been a mixed bag at the best of times and utter disaster at the worst . that 's the fault of shortterm thinkers in the oil and auto industry i prefer to blame w 's stupid foreign policy for the supply problems of the last 10 years than anything else . it 's just not that simple . bush kicked the anthill , but the truth of the matter is that we 've hit our peak oil . demand has completely eclipsed supply and all we can do now is hope to god we can pump faster than we slurp . canadian tar sands , dredging the gulf , stripping the top off kuwait ... is n't going to help . global demand is simply growing too fast . carter 's conservationURL strategy is the strategy for the future . he was way ahead of the game when he pushed it in the 70s , but the idea of insulating windows and putting on a sweeter rather than cranking up the thermostat was portrayed as something unamerican for reasons only a shameless consumerist could understand . the us has a chronic oil addiction that still needs to be addressed . carter was just crucified for daring to hold an intervention . carter addressed a resource shortage responsibly and intelligently . ... and gave us the pinto , the gremlin , and the pacer while setting up japan to gut our auto industry . carter did more to gut labor in this country over the long term via misguided energy and commercial policies than any union busting republican . lulwhut ? i forgot when carter was given the chairmanship of all three major auto manufacturers . besides , since when did americans suddenly get the shivers at the idea of a little global competition ? japan made a superior car and picked up a sizable market share . the americans replied with a new fleet of vehicles i would n't be embarrassed to drive . i own a ford , and i love it . i would n't have said that back in the 80s , when toyota was still barely breaking the horizon and the big 3 thought they could get away with making cheap crap . how many billions did we piss into the desert under carter 's administration ? do n't you see ? it was his foreign policy failures iran , opec , korea that we 've been cleaning up for the last 30 years . it was his domestic policies housing especially that screwed us three years ago . the guy was an epic failure in office . he meant well , but everything he touched turned to shit . i do n't see . opec was inevitable , a product of capitalism catching hold in the middle east . the only thing carter did wrong in iran was supporting a ruthless dictator over a democratically elected government . and its a mistake the us went on to make again and again and again under reagan and bush and clinton and bush jr. obama 's break with the cycle of dictatorship support has been a huge breath of fresh air . but carter 's monarchist backer policy dates to truman and eisenhower and the postwar british reorganization of the ottoman empire . so blaming him for shit the brits laid down a century ago seems extra silly . and i 'm pretty sure north korea was the product of general mccarthry 's march into china and the resulting chinese push back . that , again , basically falls on truman 's head . still , it 's amazing how you can condense half a century of foreign policy mistakes under a single democrat administration conveniently wedged in between 20 years of republican presidency . i guess i did n't realize how incredibly effective the blame carter '' rightwing attacks have been . four years in the late seventies become the root of all evil for a quarter century before and after . truly amazing .	c3e71s7	Economics

consider that we have a system of currency ... a system that is n't barter . in order for your strict connection between supply and demand to be accurate , we 'd have live under a barter system . we do n't . no you do n't . money is a claim on real value . it is merely a medium of exchange . we live under a currency system where there is no hard and fast connection between produced goods and capacity to purchase those goods . there is an indirect connection , but it is not only indirect but also incomplete . for instance , while it should n't do so , the treasury could if it were legal to do so print a special batch of 1,000 20 bills and give them directly to you for the heck of it . this 20,000 would have no impact on anything other than the amount of cash you had . assuming no newspapers caught wind of it , an addition of 20,000 would almost certainly go entirely unnoticed by the money markets and financial systems . it 's too minuscule to have any measurable effect on the money supply . it would n't likely touch inflation levels at all . all it would do is give you more money to spend . but even low levels of counterfeiting have negative effects . 20,000 might not be enough to have widespread macro effects but if they gave 20,000 to everyone , it would . if you were able to print up 20,000 and buy things it would be a fraud . you would be getting goods and services for free . the whole purpose of money is an exchange of value . you provided x of value to the economy and are therefore compensated with wages . you then use your wages to exchange with other goods and services . that would create 15,000 of effective demand in the economy with absolutely no increased production . done . voila . again , you are just committing fraud . you are able to redistribute resources towards yourself , but you have n't created '' demand . if i print up 15,000 and spend it i have n't increased demand , i have merely engaged in a fraudulent scheme to redistribute goods and services to myself . my printing up of 15k does not add to the stock of goods and services . i do n't create wealth . i merely obtain wealth through counterfeit .	c6ahfs9	Economics

two caveats apply when drawing policy conclusions from the analysis in this paper firstly , it should be noted that this paper analyses the effects of different taxes on economic growth , which may not be the only objective of tax policy design . the distributional effects of different taxes an analysis of which is beyond the scope of this paper may also influence tax policy design , so that one should not blindly equate growthfriendly with politically desirable . in some cases , there may be tradeoffs between different policy objectives , although in many cases such a tradeoff does not exist . all this said , economic growth remains the precondition for the improvement of material living standards , and taxation is not the only policy lever available to advance distributional objectives . secondly , any empirical insight generated from crosscountry macro data only reveals a picture that is true on average . under specific circumstances in specific country cases , there may be reasons to expect deviations from the general patterns presented here , and to assume different effects of certain tax instruments . such cases could arise , for example , where countries already rely very heavily on one of the tax instruments identified here , so as to make them significant outliers from the sample average . a closer look at the specific situation of a given country is therefore needed before making policy recommendations on the basis of the empirical analysis presented here . for most cases , however , tax reforms towards property and consumption taxes , and especially away from corporate taxes , are likely to enhance the prospects for economic growth . there 's more than a few caveats in there ...	c6ohgmh	Economics

yeah , the cases of scandinavia other countries who have managed to make socialized medicine work are perplexing to those of us who are from the more austrian school . but , when you think about it , those countries are n't spending at least 13 of their tax receipts on warweaponsforeign aid warbased . when you factor in past war costs and the debt upkeep , it 's more like 12 of all tax dollars going to war . health costs associated w war only make things worse . medical concerns which had largely been in the private domain in the nineteenth century increasingly became a concern of the state . the physician began to be transformed into a functionary of stateinitiated laws and policies . doctors slowly began to see themselves as more responsible for the public health of the nation than for the individual health of the patient . it is one thing to see oneself as responsible for the nation s health and quite another to be responsible for an individual patient s health . it is one thing to be employed by an individual , another to be employed by the government . under the weimar republic these reforms resulted in clearly improved public health . however , the creativity , energy , and fundamental reforms found in social medicine during the weimar republic seem in retrospect a short and deceptive illusion . medical reformers had wanted to counter the misery inherited from the first world war and the second empire on the basis of comprehensive disease prevention programs . in the few years available to the social reformers , they had remarkable success . but in connection with these reforms the doctor s role changed from that of advocate , adviser , and partner of the patient to a partner of the state . end war . it 's possible . if you do n't think it is , consult with the people who said the same about slavery .	c5wupdt	Economics

lol its not simply supply and demand , that is part of the story , but not even close to the most important factor . oil is priced in dollars , the dollar has fallen in value a lot since 20012002 dollar index since 1990 URL and when you look at the value of the dollar across the 20th century 19002000 dollar value index URL we begin to see why a house that once cost 12,000 now costs 580,000. why eggs used to cost pennies and now cost dollars , etc etc . supply and demand are extreme oversimplificiations of the pricing factors . yes demand has increased , but supply hasnt exactly fallen off to levels that would explain the rapid increase . in any event this does not explain an exponential rise on the cost of gas , remember gas used to cost 915 cents a gallon when my dad started driving . has demand outstripped supply 2050x ? ? no . sorry , folks . it 's simply supply and demand . u.s. demand just is n't the only big player anymore . therefore this , is an explaination i would expect to see in a high school economics classroom , missing other larger macro issues like the erosion of dollar vis a vis the petrodllar and it 's implications for the price of goods .	c456r0r	Economics

think about it trivially , a group of islanders each own a bond that pays 1000 annually and consumption is 1000. interest rates double , the value i.e . wealth of the community is cut in half , yet consumption is still 1000. except that , in the real world , you 're going to face a steep margin call if the value of your wealth is cut in half . if you are a lender , this means that you 're going to stop lending and liquidate to meet the margin call . this means that the businesses you loan money to on a shortterm basis are n't going to get the money they need to fund their daily operations , meaning that those businesses are going to have to liquidate and lay off workers . this means that the laidoff workers are now going to spend less , because they no longer have any income . when people spend less money , this reduces overall output . now , you could argue that the shortterm credit markets would n't have frozen up if the fed were targeting ngdp , but that 's besides the point . the whole reason why the margin call came about was because of the decline in wealth . and the whole reason why the decline in wealth came about was because the housing bubble burst . in other words , i 'm targeting the source of the chain reaction you 're trying to stop the chain reaction somewhere in the middle , once it 's already underway . in my opinion , preventing the chain reaction from beginning is the much more prudent macro policy . monetary policy is clearly not a panacea , but using monetary policy to attempt to correct '' current account deficits or prick '' asset bubbles is a recipe for disaster . if i made any error , it was probably using the word prick . '' all greenspan would have had to do was speak publicly about the housing bubble in the early 2000s , and the bubble would have deflated itself . there would have been no unintended consequences . i guess the word prick '' makes it sound like there would be unintended consequences my bad . on the issue of the current account , i never said it was the fed 's role to close the current account deficit . the current account deficit came about as a result of political reasons . a lot of it has to do with asian countries pegging their currencies to the dollar , but it also has to do with the elite politicians in the u.s. reaganclintonURL who cheered the massively strong dollar , which destroyed our manufacturing base and which set the stage for the fire economy and its inevitable collapse . the fed should undoubtedly be trying to reduce the value of the dollar and rebalance global capital flows , but the problem did n't originate as a monetary policy problem .	c4wtp8q	Economics

there is no more of a disconnect now than when the industrial revolution started . exactly ... this process has been taking place for hundreds of years . maybe thousands . that 's how exponential growth works . it starts slowly , but then gets larger faster . this is part of the plan to develop poor countries low hanging fruit and concentrate wealth and power into a few hands at the same time . you describe it like there 's some grand conspiracy ... i doubt it . i think income equality is a natural progression of capitalism developing technological production methods . three groups of people are developed . obviously at the very top are the owners . below them are the skilled workers . these are the engineers who developed the machines , doctors , but also craftsmen and handymen . this group has higher bargaining power , and its for a simple reason . supply and demand . the group is relatively large as a whole , but since its divided by niches each group that matters is small , and because their output is unique and useful ... there 's high demand . our country was founded on the idea that everyone could be part of this group . early technology was effective at making individual workers more productive , but it did n't replace workers . what you saw was a higher output by individuals who still had some sense of bargaining power . one of the major innovations within the past 100 years is technology has evolved to the point where it does more then enable an individual ... it practically replaces them . this creates the third group . on the bottom has always been service workers . as pressures such as technology and even offshoring ... which is kind of a different discussion start to replace workers from the middle group they start to move . if the person does not have the ability to learn a new skill still in demand from the first group , they 'll inevitably end up in the bottom group . this bottom group has a major disadvantage . it 's large , and generic . each individual has little bargaining power . so you see major income equality . balance trade lets talk about offshoring now . the idea that balancing trade will improve the middle class , is kind of a naive idea . it assumes that because foreign countries can do a job cheaper , they are also doing it in the optimal sense . that if we balance trade , the incentive to move jobs to foreign countries will diminished so the same job done in say china will now be done in the us , but with a higher wage . i 'd disagree . my argument is that offshore labor is more of a convenience then an economic necessity . if and when the jobs leave foreign countries , when they arrive in the us they will be very different . they will arrive as requiring a more skilled worker to control and design automated machines . what wo n't come is the need for thousands of people to do repetitive assembly line work . that kind of work is from the past , and its basically done . so in a short sense , no . bringing manufacturing back will not solve our social problems . eventually institute a guaranteed income , making work optional . i 'll agree with you here ... eventually this will become a necessity . except it does n't appear that we have any choice in the matter . democracy is dead . this is a long discussion .	c6ium6u	Economics

helvering v. davis i 've looked over that decision briefly and found nothing to suggest that . what parts do you think back your claim ? flemming v. nestor is about the ability of cancel benefits on a case by case basis not the design of the program . no , that was the background of the case that was brought before , the opinion stated more broadly that there is no constitutional right to receive social security payments , despite paying into the system . you can read more here URL , directly from the ssa the fact that workers contribute to the social security program 's funding through a dedicated payroll tax establishes a unique connection between those tax payments and future benefits . more so than general federal income taxes can be said to establish rights '' to certain government services . this is often expressed in the idea that social security benefits are an earned right . '' this is true enough in a moral and political sense . but like all federal entitlement programs , congress can change the rules regarding eligibility and it has done so many times over the years . the rules can be made more generous , or they can be made more restrictive . benefits which are granted at one time can be withdrawn , as for example with student benefits , which were substantially scaledback in the 1983 amendments . and from the majority opinion a person covered by the social security act has not such a right in oldage benefit payments as would make every defeasance of accrued '' interests violative of the due process clause of the fifth amendment do you have anything more substantial to back up your claim ? even if and that 's a big if they found in helvering v. davis that contributions have to be tied to payments , it seems like this was reversed in flemming .	c80zy08	Economics
i think it 's important to keep things in perspective . as much as it 's good to be highly critical of research that is careless , we are talking about a single paper here , and one that was published in conference proceedings at the end of the day an 8 page synopsis of a paper presented , which is not at all the same as a refereed journal article . the authors may have made errors , but to me any blame for the impact on policy lies squarely on the politicians ' shoulders . it 's not surprising that politicians with an agenda took evidence from a single , nonrefereed article to push their policies through . it would n't be the first time , and it 's irresponsible for any government department or agency to make any big decisions based on such scant evidence , to not conduct their own analysis and check some numbers . but in my opinion , this view is not as interestingscandalous of a news story as a headline blaming two prominent , iveyleague economists causing a global policy crisis with bad statistics . the media loves this angle , but to me it 's absurd to blame the results of a single conference paper on government policy , regardless of who wrote it . and the main message of the author 's work that debt is harmful for growth and needless to say , risk exposure is still true after these corrections , even if the picture is not as stark as originally portrayed .	c9ma90y	Economics

plenty of people have replied to other parts of your comment so i 'll address one specific thing . you say all it takes is for the global economy to lose faith in the dollar and our bonds .

'' all it takes is for the sun to go supernova and humanity is wiped out . all it takes is for the right virus to evolve and the zombie apocalypse is suddently all too real . i 'm obviously exaggerating a bit here , but the point is it would take a whole helluva lot for the world to lose faith in the us economy though the house republicans are doing their damndest . all those trillions would have to flee to something else , and what would that be ? i guess you could argue for the euro , but is europe in that great of shape ? they 're a collection of nations rather than states , so there 's probably more instability there than in the us . china ? not for a good while . they 're still more or less a dictatorship that only selectively honors international norms . the us is still the world 's greatest wealth generator , and still a functioning democracy again , house reps are doing their damndest ... so i do n't see any immediate threat , though defaulting on the debt would suddenly , needlessly , stupidly call our willingness to pay our bills into question . and if you think this is all abstract , remember that the cost of borrowing really does tell you what the world thinks of our creditworthiness . the world is dying to loan us money , because in the middle of a worldwide recession they still assume we 're the safest bet .	ccmv607	Economics

i 'd like to open by explaining that if peak oil was bullshit , then we would n't need to frack at all . even the time we 're wasting typing this is an economic cost attributable to peak oil . the theory simply states that more and more compromises and costs and consumption will be required , per barrel , as we exploit the cheapest , easiest oil first . the fact that fracking is worth the hassle is a tangible effect of peak oil fracking wo n't produce , say , 30 million barrels per day every year for fifty years . if you can give me numbers like that from a new technology then i 'll reconsider my position . at a demand of around 8590 million barrels a day and rising then if you 're piddling around talking about 35 million bbl a year for 510 years , then who cares ? lots of money , but no substantial change in the outcome or the time frame is it ? wti is hardly some kind of expected standard . if you want to make nonsense of the entire peak oil paradigm . '' then you 'll need to replace declining sources with sources that are n't both more expensive and more destructive . i guess cheaper is an overstatement , perhaps roughly equivalent '' would be better . if you believe that , then i do n't think you understand much about the oil industry . perhaps . i 'm only an observer , after all . however , i ca n't find any sources that have fracking extracting oil at the sort of traditional well costs of , say , 10 to 20 a barrel or so usually three or four times this price . further , the support infrastructure for fracking is much greater than is required for the wells we used before they peaked . we used to just dump light sweet crude from underground storage into tankers that was so good the tankers could just run their engines on the crude . oil sold at 20 per barrel , more or less , for many decades . now there are trucks carrying water around the countryside , people complaining all over the place , and the oil extraction is often displacing or reducing other economic activities in a way that it was n't before . these are all costs , added to the economic bottom line as basic operating costs required to keep the lights on . fracking is n't ushering an incredible new opportunity for us the way that coal or oil or electricity did when first introduced , it 's a lot of headaches endured just to keep things the same . the party 's over oil , war , and the fate of industrial societies '' has better descriptions of how we are pedalling faster to stay still . i recommend you read the prize the quest for money , power and oil before you say anything more . i see your recommendation or at least i will and raise you twilight in the desert the coming saudi oil shock and the world economy note you say 'traditional ' wells you are assuming , like peak oilists do , that technologoy remains static . saying traditional wells '' does n't imply that tech remains static . in this context , traditional means ones in which you do n't need the tech . look , if there was a field like ghawar in the continental usa found tomorrow , the price of oil would fall and the fancy technology would n't be needed . yet if you read about the oil industry over time , technology has never been static . you should n't get hung up on this technology thing . sometimes a discovery is made that makes a process simpler , cheaper and cleaner , but more often than not new tech allows additional possibilities or exploitation at the cost of extra energyURL inputs , more unwanted sideeffects read why things bite back '' or greater complexity , which carries risk the up side of down '' .	c81bdtb	Economics

there is a big difference between inflation and the cpi . do n't tell krugman . commodity indexes are up sharply , tracking the monetary base . similar thing with consumables like food . what is allowing krugman to claim victory on the back of the defunct cpi is quite simple . with the imploding domestic economy , firms like gm are slashing wages and benefits and thereby maintaining flat prices on their products . this is true of every sector where labor supply exceeds demand , i.e. , almost the entire economy . if workers were not being faced with rapidly declining nominal wages , you 'd see effects closer to what the austrians predict show up in even the cpi . where the austrians come up short is that they see this development in terms of an exponential curve , runaway inflation . this wo n't happen . reality is more like running into a brick wall all of a sudden . consider that throughout the entire crisis , domestic manufacturing has not recovered . there is no new tech bubble on the horizon . much capital has been sunk into firms that will never produce any value like facebook . the economy is less sustainable each successive year of bad policy . where does this lead ? eventually you do get a crisis confidence in us government debt . the fed is now net purchaser of 85 billion per month in tbills about 23 of the market and has more or less been doing this for the last 45 years . this could continue into an exponential sort of hyperinflation scenario , but we 're a good ways off from that . in all likelihood , there is a confidence crisis first and the bottom just drops out overnight . probably the very first day that a reliable form of liquidity exists besides the dollar . we have significant military operations to prevent the development of a liquidity alternative . libya , syria , iran , iraq ... these boys have something in common and it is their effort to decouple from the dollar reserve system . china , russia , india , and others are working on it now and they wo n't topple so easily . the question is really one of military superiority , and this reality of course has nothing to do with krugman 's nonsensical ranting .	c7u6wv2	Economics

no . next to carpet bombing , rent control is the most efficient technique known so far for destroying the housing stock of cities . '' assar lindbeck , chairman of the nobel prize committee for economics . some years ago the aer , the premier peerreviewed economics journal , conducted an international survey of economists to see what they agreed and disagreed upon , and found that the one thing economists worldwide agreed upon most is that rent control is bad '' . and it screws the poor too ! and the tale always told to sell it to voters , it helps the needy , by keeping the price of housing low '' , is a total crock . as the story you link to indicates , more politely than i would . as a nycer with many years personal experience with it i can tell you the rich and connected win , the people who actually most need apartments lose . the winners are those with rent controlled apartments . they pay less than the market rate , and stay in their apartments forever , so their gains get bigger and bigger every year . often they sublet for a profit , taking money right from the landlord sticking it to tenants . of course that 's illegal but the provisions prohibiting that are utterly unenforceable . that screws the market because people who need apartments are forced to pony up more to the subletting profiteers , while the landlords get 0 to increase supply or improve or maintain quality . plus those with knowledge and connections game the system . congressman charlie rangel had four ! rent controlled apartments , until the newspapers found out and shamed him into giving them up . he 's not exactly poor and needy , eh ? the losers are everybody else . with the housing stock slashed , plus all the hoarding of it caused by the price controls , market prices go up for everybody who is looking for an apartment in the market . exactly comparable apartments rent for far higher prices than controlled apartments there . and of course the people seeking apartments in the market are disproportionately the young and the poorer , new arrivals in town , and those starting families needing more living space . while those benefiting from the controls are the older and the richer . i personally know of a dozen bizarreabusive situations resulting from rent control rules . here 's just one the entire top floor of a 5story an apartment building on 10th street , just off fifth avenue and washington square , nyu area , beautiful area ! was lived in alone by an 80odd year old woman . it had been hard controlled '' for decades , she was paying 150 a month , literally , for 3 bedrooms , 2 baths , porches in each direction overlooking the park and fifth ave. , etc . she had most of it blocked off , unused , because she had no need of it and it was too much trouble to clean . on the ground floor the landlord created a small new apartment to lease at market rent , in no small part to cover the loss on the top floor . this was like 3.5 rooms , and a family of four young couple , 2 small kids moved into it for 2,500 rent . this was bizarre to everybody , and the old lady had finally grown tired of the upkeep on her huge apartment . so all the parties lady , family , landlord agreed to have the tenants swap apartments , keeping their rents . so the family would get the big old apartment for 2,500 , and the lady would get the small new one for 150 ground floor was easier for her to access too . all three parties had to pay lawyers to present this proposal to the rent control board . everybody involved wanted it win , win , win . no objections from anybody . all for it . of course , the rent control board said ... '' no ! it 's illegal ! ! ! did i mention that how many hundreds of millions of dollars nyc taxpayers must pony up each year to pay for the rent control bureaucracy , including an entire additional court system , to enforce such craziness with such rulings ? true story . i was there . the building had been left as an endowment gift to a charity , the losses on the building were costing the charity money a moneylosing endowment ! , and i was on the board of the charity trying to work this deal out . here 's a shorthand tip about economics that you can count on 99 of the time price controls any price controls bad . and politically they are always sold on the false promise that they will help the people they actually hurt the most .	c7qokfo	Economics
so , it looks like france inflated its way out of the debt . the chart shows a nice threefold increase in the price level that would get the us debt down to around 25 of gdp . i guess that is one way to do it especially if the inflation is unexpected , so that the losses all fall on the borrowers lenders who thought your country was a reliable lender borrower . hopefully , once you get the debt down , you wo n't have to go back to them to borrow again . that could happen , for example , because your policymakers learn their lesson and become fiscally responsible for at least a generation . just how would we go about engineering the necessary inflation for the us today ? our rate of inflation has been running below the fed 's 2 target for some time now , despite extraordinary efforts at expansionary monetary policy . where are those bond vigilantes when we need them ?	c88lhrw	Economics

in the case of fastfood joints and downtownkilling walmart , i 'm not so sure that case can be made . you know running business like a business . that should be the real question of economics . all businesses have access to the same labor pool of subsidized workers , since workers are free to come and go from whatever business they can get a job at . it is therefore logical to assume that if a business eg walmart is the most competitive local business whilst subsidized labor is available , that it would also be the most competitive local business when the subsidy goes away , since the subsidy going away would effect the labor pool for all businesses , not just the one . you 're being awfully slow and selective in reading your smith adam smith is not the beall , endall of economics . and i never fucking asked for adam smith 's opinion on the issue you just seem intent on giving it . as you said yourself , adam smith lived in a time where some of the economics ideas around today did n't even exist , or were just coming into play . it is therefore unlikely that his work will have a comprehensive explanation or understanding of a modern economy and all of its issues . once the lower classes lose their ability to survive , the problem manifests upstream . i 've already explained why the lower classes ceasing to survive can not happen under normal market circumstances . if portions of them did die off or cease to reproduce over time , the demand for their labor would rise over that same time period , and thus the wages paid to them would rise . in which case , should a declining economic output be inevitable based on history , there is no indication that this is the case . the only possible argument that you can even make to support this supposition is that economic output may decrease when the earth runs out of certain limited resources ie minerals or metals needed in manufacturing . but even this occurrence would not likely lead to permanent economic stagnation , but merely a slowing down of the trend of consistent economic growth . the question becomes one of how to reduce the population and demands on subsistence in a morally acceptable way . according to current estimates , the earth 's population will stop growing at around 10 billion people , and may even start to decline after that .	cfq5oln	Economics

so , once again , just questions . the mainstreamers predicted from the start that the stimulus was too small , and would have an effect at the start , but would not be big enough to turn the economy around quickly . people , like krugman said this , and also said that due to the stimulus being too small it would likely lead to a little increase , and then a decline , and possible doubledip recession at a minimum it would lead to a prolonged downturn . others like him wrote that the quantitative easing program would not lead to much of a recovery , but was better than nothing in the absence of a larger , or another stimulus also , that it would not lead to runaway inflation , and would lead to small , if any inflation . this is what happened . austrians on the other hand said the stimulus would crash the economy did n't happen , and that each round of quantitative easing would lead to runaway inflation . when that did n't happen they said they were right , and that the bls was hiding the true inflation figures , which was proven by the price in gold and oil , which would be at new permanent highs , along with all other commodities , because the us dollar was valueless , and commodities were the only true store of value . they loves spouting b.s . about zimbabwe , the weimar republic , and goldline being your savior . when that did n't turn out to be true they claimed victory , and started saying how rude leftleaning economists were to them . every one of them is a clown , as are their followers . where is that runaway inflation again ? still just around the corner , '' or imminent , '' or already underway , '' or just being hidden by the government ?	cmtnjw8	Economics

ok . i 'm all for that . that 's probably one of the best ways to fight inequitable wealth distribution . what are we arguing about ? well initially it was over the fact that you were saying productivity should go handinhand with real wages . i 'm saying that 's not necessarily true because an increase in productivity is n't necessarily coming from the workers , it could come from something else . so if somebody does something that makes me more efficient at my job , that person should receive compensation , not me . why ? this is one of the assumptions i 'm talking about . if you read the theory behind capitalism you will find that the underlying assumptions are more or less what i stated . i guess i assumed that you were operating from those same assumptions but i guess you 're operating from other ones . it is not self evident that the creators of business should own it or that businesses should be owned by an individual or owned at all . this is a little harder to argue for things like small business although i think its still true since ownership makes intuitive sense in general but especially to someone raised in an economy like the us . but simply because something makes intuitive sense does n't make it right and it should be easier to see the issues that arise when you 're talking about very large corporations where the concept of ownership and its implications and impacts become much murkier and when a single individual can only very occasionally have even a mildly significant impact on the corporation as a whole . at any rate any competent economic theory that posits private ownership should have at least some rational basis justifying that assumption other than because owners own '' and ideally some sort of empiricaltheoretical model for its impacts that demonstrate why it is the best choice . i think it depends on what your views on property rights are like . i start with the assumption that if you create something , you own it . i say assumption , but it really is n't . what else would be the case ? who would own it if not for the creator ? it would n't exist without its creator . this makes sense on a moral level if you think property rights is a moral issue , which i do , and it makes sense practically speaking because if you take away an incentive like that to create a business , less business will be created . i just do n't feel it 's accurate to act like this idea is an assumption . as you say , it makes intuitive sense . but again , i need to know what the alternative is to make any kind of an argument for the current system . i think capitalism and private property rights are important to prosperity . i also think they 're as close to morally fair as you can get .	ceuuupl	Economics

first off , the idea that mass pollution or carbon output is the sole domain of capitalism is completely false . if you look at the communist regimes of the 20th century they were far more pollutive , all while being far less economically efficient and successful . that is , despite the fact that many had environmental quotas to meet , quotas that were ignored because industry and public policy makers were too close to one another . many feel we have a problem now simply because corporations have too much lobbying power , what makes people think we would be better off if lobbying was n't needed because industry and public policy literally emanated from the same place ? in capitalism , where the means of production are separate from the statepublic , the statepublic ironically gains more power to be able to force restrictions ala environmental regulations on industry . look at the clean air and water acts of the 70 's , both were hugely environmentally successful , and private enterprise was innovative enough to continue growing within the affected industries . just as in the separation of powers on the governmental level , there is a benefit to separating the powers on a broader level the means of production separated from governments . a government which can represent the interests of the broad public not capitalist owners or laborers is more likely to , and more capable of , reining in industry 's excesses . for example , there is a powerful argument to be made that a carbon tax is needed to deal with the rise in carbon pollution . a free market system gives us the best chance of adapting our energy needs to such policy while limiting economic damage . also , as far as standard of living goes , i think it 's important to recognize capitalism 's ability to broadly disseminate technology and make it affordable for everyone . in terms of technological innovation , the government undoubtably has an important role to play in terms of r d . nasa is a good example of this , and similarly , the ussr had a robust space program in their heyday as well . however , it takes a free market system to take a technological innovation regardless of it 's origin and make it broadly useable and cost efficient for everyone . that is why luxury items air conditioning , flat screen tv 's , computers become commonplace items for people in the bottom 10 , ten years after they were owned by a small number of wealthy people at the top .	cmqfhiv	Economics

it 's not an insane pipe dream . of course you are going to have to raise taxes . you probably will have to raise taxes a whole lot . however , a rise in taxes wo n't mean less money in people 's pockets since that money will go right back to them in the form of ubi . so for example , completely made up numbers say you get 100,000 and you currently pay 20 taxes . so right now you will be paying 20,000 a year in taxes . we can even double your taxes to 40 but also give you a 20,000 ubi , and in the end , you will be paying the exact same amount . 40,000 , minus the 20,000 from ubi 20,000 . in this example assuming a flat tax , if you earn 50,000 you now pay 0 in taxes and if you earn 200,000 your taxes will be increased by 20,000 . it is n't all that unreasonable , even with a completely unreasonable increase in taxes and an unreasonably high ubi of 20,000 it still makes sense . only the people in the higher brackets will see a significant reduction , all the rest will see an increase of monthly income or will remain the same .	cfc8t7s	Economics

anybody who thinks politics is more polarized today than during the days of mobs outside the white house chanting for months on end , '' hey , hey lbj , how many kids did you kill today ? ... regular race riots across us inner cities ... nixon and agnew and their 'silent majority ' versus 'hanoi jane ' fonda ... domestic terrorists blowing up buildings and robbing banks in the us ... student strikes shutting down campuses across the us ... the national guard shooting students dead in the kent state massacre ... and 20 other things i could name ... certainly was n't alive back then and is totally oblivious to plain obvious history . i was alive back then as one of those students , and can tell you for a fact the us voting population is less polarized today than at any time in the last 50 years a fact backed up by recent gallup polls that show fewer voters selfdescribe as being partisan democrats or republicans today than at any time since pollsters started asking the question decades ago . what has happened is that the parties have polarized with conservative democrats and liberal republicans disappearing . this is largely due to the 'increase in democracy ' that 's resulted from open primaries replacing party bosses in smokefilled rooms as the means of picking candidates . in open primaries the minority of highlymotivated outsidewing activists disproportionately dominate over the apathetic moderate majority and the evergrowing number of independents do n't vote at all ... with the result that conservative democrats and liberal republicans are purged . all new liberal candidates become democrats and all conservative candidates become republicans . but this is just a sorting out '' process among the parties , the article totally misrepresents it in claiming the chart reflects increasing polarization in the attitudes of citizenry . moreover , this sorting out of the parties is a return to normalcy . throughout history , the parties on the whole have always been very highly partisan . see eg , 1840s , 1850s , 1860s . the temporary 'reduced polarization ' between the parties was driven by the shock of world war ii , which buried typical partisan rifts , and put in place a unique generation of conservative democratsliberal republicans as incumbents who knew how to keep their jobs through the power of incumbency . you can plainly see this in that chart . inequality plunged during the great depression , yet partisanshipbetweentheparties on the chart from 1917 all the way through the depression to its very end 1941 was as high as in recent years , no decline then after 1941 in the 1940s it fell straight down ! for the period from 1941 to 1943 the author ca n't think of anything that might have reduced partisan fighting between the parties other than inequality '' ? i might also add that as the voting majority becomes ever more moderate while the parties become ever more polarized , the party activists and their allied punditocracies become ever more polarized and more extreme in trying to whip up moderates to come over to their sides . articles like this are a typical example . the author is either very disingenuous in spinning the sorting out of the parties as illustrating increasing partisanship of the masses in spite of mountains of obvious evidence to the contrary or very naive in believing what was spun to him still being blind to all the obvious evidence to the contrary , because he wants to believe this . fortunately the american masses remain less partisan than ever , notwithstanding all the spin spun at them . the combined ratings of msnbc , cnn , fox , et al . are dwarfed by those of dancing with the stars , football , and the semimindless entertainments of the massive majority of contented , politically apathetic americans .	chxbdve	Economics

this is the type of post that makes me almost want to cry . it 's a seriously failed grasp of history . odd . that 's the exact same response i had to reading your post . ... gained it 's strength from unemployment and severe economic downturns . not from alcohol . wikipedia disagrees . while the mafia existed prior to prohibition , the decoupling of law and morality gave it a much easier time operating as well as a considerable new source of revenue . yes , organized crime of the era did not begin with prohibition or limit itself to alcohol smuggling , however , the smuggling gave it a thin veneer of legitimacy that allowed it more freedom to operate without being reported by ordinary citizens . also with the exception of extortionURL every one of those activities are only possible because of dubious prohibitions by government . prohibition is what makes organized crime possibleprofitable . URL ... alcohol prohibition successfully dropped drinking rates dramatically ... i guess that depends on what you call dramatically . according to wikipedia again scholars estimate that consumption dropped to a low of about 60 of preprohibition levels around 1925 , rising to almost 80 before the law was officially repealed . '' to claim that prohibition did not fail is the real asinine position . the country rejected it hard enough to pass a constitutional amendment to end the ban . since the founding of the country there have only been 27 amendments , two of which were the banning of alcohol sales and the repeal thereof . URL fourth , let 's just go ahead and assume murder rates really do go up based on prohibition . you ca n't just trim off direct murder from criminal activity as the only concern . murder is not the only harm that comes from overly broad prohibition . there is everything from wasted human capital , to mental and physical suffering from incarceration to contempt for authority and law and increased conflict with law enforcement to lowered taxes based on unreported revenue . in all but the most egregious , widely accepted examples , the prohibition is worse then the activity it is trying to prevent . the simple fact is if you ban something the majority wants , you cause more harm in enforcement then good by its prevention . tldr mind your own business , prohibitionist ! your grasp of history is at best no better than mine .	cg3yv03	Economics

they will be forced to raise rates once their fiduciary duty demands it . 0 rates are not sustainable indefinitely . that 's not really an answer . i 'll take the other side of that and say it is sustainable indefinitely . tell me why i 'm wrong . and of course the central banks could issue the money needed to cover the debt assuming they can be compelled to do so they 're independent entities . the central bank is an agency of the government . subordinate to the sovereign , with a measure of political independence . many countries have tried that experiment before and it always leads to an inflation shock . what 's the argument that says it leads to an inflation shock ? inflation effects , if any , can derive from the initial spending and would be seen in the period where the money is spent . after the fact , when those effects have already played out , what difference does it make if the private sector is holding interestbearing yen or noninterestbearing yen ?	cm6fdz6	Economics

it 's not hard to make a case for outright bans . like an outright ban on tiger penis , for example . many , many commodities are subject to outright bans and many more are subject to tight restrictions for very legitimate reasons . and while i do n't agree with the export ban , there is a justification for it . if the us exports crude , there will be diminished demand for native refining capacity . we have a strong national security interest in keeping a strong domestic refining system at all times . our entire military is dependent on oil to operate . without it , we 're hamstrung . if we are dependent on foreign refining capacity , foreign suppliers of refined products will be able to exercise influence over our military decisions . however , i think that offshoring of refineries is unlikely , especially given how dominant the us is in the sector , how capital intensive plants are , how dependent they are on highskill labor , and how little lowskill labor they need . nor will exporting crude reduce demand in the us for refined products , and since the cheapest place to refine products to supply the us market is in the us itself , then it is unlikely refineries will see a decline in demand for their services . i think mostly what we would start see happening is perhaps a small spike in california gas prices as the refineries there start competing with china for west coast crudes like the stuff they pump locally in la . but that 's such a small segment of crude production that any effect would be de minimis . otherwise , everything gets pumped through cushing , ok , or is produced in the gulf . in either of which cases , the closest and cheapest refineries are on the gulf coast in the us . even if refineries in china and europe start competing for us crude , the crude has to be exported from gulf ports , which is where 75 of the us refining capacity is located anyway . so the us refineries can outbid their foreign competitors because they do n't need to absorb the shipping costs , including price uncertainty and the time value lost during shipping . the possible negative for the us there is that we might see the gap between brent crude prices and west texas intermediate prices close , driving up us gas prices . currently the export ban restricts arbitrage very weakly if at all because people can still arbitrage with the finished petroleum prices without seeing a serious increase in prices given how cheap us refineries are , and given that those refineries are located on the same export hubs as for crude . if it does restrict arbitrage , being able to export from cushing via the gulf could theoretically drive the wti and brent prices back together , but i doubt it . new outbound pipelines from cushing are more likely to have a big effect on the wtibrent gap than anything else . their problem is inbound capacity far exceeding outbound , leading to gluts , not that there is n't demand at the end of the outbound pipelines , just that those pipelines were n't upgraded fast enough to deal with changing demand for us crudes .	cekq259	Economics

abstract this paper estimates the effects of postandhold laws on alcohol consumption and price . postandhold laws require alcohol wholesalers to provide a list of prices to the state , which can be reviewed by retailers , competitors and the public . these laws were generally enacted at the end of prohibition with the intention of limiting alcohol consumption by raising prices . the laws may also have the unintended consequence of protecting small retailers . recently , several large retailers have argued in court that these laws are counter to the sherman act , which limits anticompetitive behavior . this paper follows the recent paper by cooper and wright 2012 and adds new data and new statistical tests . both differenceindifference models and synthetic control models are employed . the estimation results provide no persuasive evidence of an effect of postandhold laws on the consumption of either beer , wine , or spirits . there is also no persuasive evidence that the laws increase the prices of these products . one possible explanation of this null effect is that the wholesale markets for alcohol are so highly regulated that postandhold laws have no discernable marginal effect . the empirical results presented in this paper do support alcohol excise taxes as effective means of reducing alcohol consumption .	ctepdtd	Economics

URL see for yourself . can you stop a recession without doubling down on bad investments or are those two things always linked ? i 'm of the persuasion that recessions are good and natural , and the only things that should be done during a recession are things that would be equally productive outside of a recession . necessary infrastructure is great , unnecessarily repaving roads to create jobs is not . a recession is clearing out unproductive investments , and many people try to prevent those recessions by pumping additional money into those investments . here is a quick example local government borrows some money to build a new convention center . convention center employs a bunch of people , and their consumption creates a lot of secondary and tertiary economic activity . convention center starts to struggle though , and has to lay people off and might go completely bankrupt . if you let the center go bankrupt , lots of people lose their jobs , lots of economic activity stops , local economy goes into recession . if you borrow more money and pump it into the convention center , those people do n't lose their jobs , and economy is still strong . the latter choice might be better in the short run , but could be very bad in the long run .	cxiiwde	Economics

it seems to me that the problem is that no one even looks at the new oven as a viable investment because there 's no anticipated growth in sales from expanding because no one has extra money to spend . well , that 's the argument you 'll hear from keynesian economists , certainly . the chicagoschool is often referred to as the supplyside '' economics , for a reason . keynesians believe that simply lowering interest rates is insufficient . you need to get money into the hands of individuals with the highest propensity to spend . that means publicsector hiring , more generous social spending , and public investment in works that the private sector would not normally fund classically , this has been infrastructure like roads and bridges and parks . but you 're right . per the theory , if borrowing 500 at 0 wo n't result in a 500 yield , there 's no demand for the oven . it will never be purchased and the economy will remain intransigent .	cugu7qk	Economics

the exact same applies for sports venues . nonlarge market sports stadiums are underproduced due to the gap between the supply of teams and the demand for teams by these markets . the government money provides the means for the local municipality to cover the difference between the supply and demand curves . if governments refused to do this , teams would move to areas that are more financially viable . our sports leagues would end up like the big european football leagues in which you might find 35 teams in some of the bigger metropolitan areas and almost no small market teams . that might not inherently be a bad thing , but it is what these government subsidies are ultimately preventing .	cpn33j9	Economics

abstract one of the most commonlyproposed policies to address the high prevalence of obesity is a tax on energydense foods , in particular sugarsweetened beverages ssbs . this is based on the assumption that such taxes are largely passed through to consumers in the form of higher retail prices , leading to reduced consumption . however , relatively little is known about the extent to which taxes on ssbs are in fact passed through to consumers . we estimate the passthrough of the first citylevel tax on ssbs in the u.s. , which was enacted by the voters of berkeley , california in november , 2014 . we collected the prices of various brands and sizes of ssbs and other beverages before and after the implementation of the tax from a nearcensus of convenience stores and supermarkets in berkeley , california . we also collected prices from stores in a control city san francisco , where in 2014 a similar voter referendum failed despite majority support . estimates from differenceindifferences and other models consistently indicate that there was relatively little pass through of the berkeley ssb tax to consumers across brands and sizes , we estimate that retail prices rose by less than half of the amount of the tax . this is in contrast to much of the previous literature on the passthrough of taxes , which tended to find full or even overshifting of taxes .	cu8x7fv	Economics

i will put this comment in another way . the assumption of ceteris paribus i.e . all other things equal is by definition the opposite of an approach that tries to account for the endogeneity the back and forth causal interplay between driving forces and results . in many cases the latter makes more sense . for example if i state ceteris paribus , the effect of a change in the interest rate lowersURL the price of bond x '' , then it might be a sensible reply to state that ceteris paribus '' , the intrest rate will never change . do you get the idea ? the thing is that most of the world can not be summarized in a straightforward one way causal framework , but requires a more advanced framework that allows effects and magnification of effects in both directions . one reason why earlier great world philosophers did not include this in their analysis , like marx , smith , and ricardo etc is just because the mathematical toolset to concider these interactions was not fully developped in that time . indeed it was only in the late 1930s that the first stepping stones in dynamic system theory where fully developped for social sciences and it took decades for people to develop their theories around it . this is a bit where the other problem is advanced methods are not easy to understand for layman . i know it is probably impossible to convince someone who has n't heard of daron acemoglu , and dynamic methods in general . given that most of the readers of picketty 's popular contribution have only read the first chapter URL , i advice them strongly not to follow blindly whatever theory is fed , but to be critical in general . one popular work , that received somewhat less attention is in fact written by acemoglu and robinson URL . i have posted this link in order that one could be provided with a reflection on the the existing stream of positive reactions to piketty 's book .	cnw8ris	Economics

this is a comparative analysis , not an absolute one . being a high school graduate used to mean something . now it does n't really . if offers little to no differentiation . i bet we could actually prove white males are smarter '' than black males on average if it were n't socially unacceptable to do such a thing . the reason you do n't do that of course is because just because i could prove that today a white man on average is smarter than a black man on average does n't make it inherently so . you could theorize a world where the opposite is true if you flipped the script . in terms of defining smarter '' i do n't disagree that intelligence is complex , however in the generic context a lot of things can accrue with the status of being a college grad . you are some cocktail of smartdiligentgood familyambitious . not all have to be true , but in general you do n't stumble into being a college grad like you do a high school grad . there is something to be said for it . the few noncollege grad success stories that people know about tend to have very unique circumstances .	cuhpb6d	Economics

ttp is intended to put everyone under a more uniform trade and accountability standard , sure . but the concern is which standard we 're going to adopt . already , we 've seen a bull rush towards asian nations designed to evade us labor law and environmental standards . ttp looks like an attempt to bring these nations more in line with our standards , from some angles . but it looks like an attempt to continue to subvert domestic law from other angles , by allowing exemptions to multinations that claim we 're a chinese firm operating in the us under chinese rules , not an american firm operating in china under american rules ! '' american businesses are rightly afraid that foreign competitors will be more lucrative when operating under foreign standards . and so there needs to be some kind of reconciliation . i just see very few people at the negotiation table actively fighting for a more allencompassing regulatory framework . more often , it looks like domestic law will be turned into loophole swiss cheese .	cq38a5l	Economics

inequality exists because those on the bottom have no money to invest into assets and no political power keep their wages up so they fall behind due to inflation . inequality is n't an employment problem . assume 100 employment for everyone over the last 50 years . inequality would be the same due to wages trailing asset prices . simply graph 4 wagesbenefits against the 8.5 of asset prices . or if 100 employment boosts wages do a 7 vs 8.5 of course you 'd have to explain the sustainability of that . as long as wages grow less than asset prices you have growing inequality .	cvh1ryz	Economics

what ? why ? do they view any particular danger of dropping interest rates down to zero ? no , they just view it as kind of pointless . pushing on thread '' and whatnot . do they think that you can have an inflationary environment and a collapse in aggregate demand ? not especially . see , for example , the phillips curve , URL an observed negative correlation between unemployment and inflation . old keynesians implicitly assumed that this curve was stable , meaning that higher inflation must be a sign of greater demand and thus lead to low unemployment . however , they failed to account for the role of expectations if inflation is persistently high , people will factor in that high inflation into their expectations , shifting the shortrun phillips curve to a series of less favorable inflationunemployment tradeoffs . i mean i guess that 's what stagflation looked like in the 70 's , but that looked to me more like a story of supply shocks than demand collapse . oil shocks constituting a negative supply shock were definitely part of the problem in the 1970s , but a significant contingent of modern macroeconomists also believe that part of the problem was that the fed had been abusing the inflationunemployment tradeoff , thus shifting the phillips curve outwards . at first i used to think old and new schools just differed in how aggressively to tackle recessions , but now i have n't the slightest idea . they both want to fight recessions aggressively , but the old keynesians emphasized fiscal policy as the means of doing so while the new keynesians emphasize monetary policy or , more precisely , interest rate policy as the means of doing so .	cw9fzd9	Economics

it is well that they try this sort of thing . however just because they admit that it is complicated and have some tools to deal with that , does not mean they get it right , it means they have accept part of the the problem . generally the more complex your analysis and tools are , the harder it to derive a clear result . the more complex and multilayered the thing you study , the more narrow the possible application of your result becomes . thats why complex systems are so hard . i appreciate how the frame it in the abstract these results suggest that it may be worthwhile to further investigate the possibility of enhanced fiscal coordination . one of the biggest reasons economics has been a negative factor fairly often is because economist were to bold to put their knowledge into effect . this is why one of the best quote is by hayek the curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design . people who look at the studies and paper on inequality that were manly written in the last 10 years and on the bases of that suggest very substantial changes of the economy fall pray to this im not saying you are one of those . im saying we should keep our eye on the phenomenon , keep researching it . their are enough other things that we know are bad , that we should definitely change . the political capital of economists and economically minded people is not that high to begin with . we not first work on issues that can bring together left and libertarian or generally marked minded people and fight corporate corruption and that might have positive an impact on inequality as well . that seems more helpful then say income inequality bad '' therefore massive wealth distribution '' is the solution . this sort of thinking is really all that i try to combat .	cwiezvx	Economics

with difficulty generally the ideal way of doing so is to target some debt level and accept that you may end up slightly above or below that level at the top end of cycle . suppose you target 30 and you currently run 35 exiting a recession then the budgetary agency would gradually increase the surplus requirement in successive years until you have reached 30 . if you do n't reach 30 before the next recession then the following boom years would have higher surplus requirements . if you reach 30 before the next recession then you can increase spending , reduce revenue or drop the surplus in to a fund to act as a budgetary buffer for recessionary years . in the case of the us instead of simply allowing congress to appropriate whatever they want whenever they want they would be subject to constraints likely formulated by bea based on where we are in the business cycle during a recession or stagnation they could spend whatever they wanted but during a recovery boom bea would give congress a fixed budget for spending based on revenue debt reduction or deficit reduction in the case of recovery . a good complimentary policy to this rule is a revenue matching rule , all spending has to be matched with a complimentary revenue source which is budgetary neutral at 5 years .	cq5j0bu	Economics

that is because that is the model that works . educated citizens have moved to the us and worked on its system of governance , its economic philosophy and tried to improve the already most developed nation in the world for over a century . once that stops , the progress made in the usa will be the model for all countries to come . a parallel can be drawn with the roman empire , who 's culture and philosophies still ring today . once humanity goes forward with an idea and it works , it is hard to regress and replace it with something worse . edit while i do n't think language is as important , individual freedom , economic theory , property rights and many other western concepts i think will be prevalent for a very long time to come regardless of superpower because those are the theories that have worked the best so far .	cpv2a7o	Economics
i do n't really know how to deal with some of the social issues tbh . gay marriage is a unique issue in caucasian dominated countries . in the rest of the world no one has any issue with not allowing gays to get married . but i think caucasians have a very long history of male homosexuality dating back to ancient greeks . so i do n't really know what to think of that . but i do n't really care about the gender equality '' stuff . i mean yes i want everyone to be treated fairly , but i care more about how well mothers take care of their children . how well families are able to function which is why raising everyone 's wages and getting free healthcare is important . as for stuff like pot or the war on drugs , i defer to scientific evidence showing weed is less harmful than alcohol , and that flat out banning drugs just creates a black market that harms people . i think in the netherlands they let people who are addicted to harmful drugs actually get government funded shots like cocaine or whatever , but have them do it in public to shame '' them or something . but in terms of economics i 'm extremely liberal . like , stimulate the economy , high taxes on the rich which will include me once i become a doctor i guess , super high taxes on the super rich it 's a pareto curve ! , and strong , effective regulation of businesses , etc . help the poor pplz , be all altruistic and stuff . also i 'd probably defund half the military .	cowhs3z	Economics

phd programs always leave the student relatively impoverished from the program itself . meaning if you have a massive undergrad bill looming , and are making a pittance at your phd program then you are on the very very edge of poverty . most phd students survive that through parental support ... hence my point . the later part of your argument is valid looking forward bc the schools have expanded those programs a lot in the past decades . but this wasnt historically true . these were relatively closed and exclusive programs as recently as a generation ago . and lastly , the biggest barrier is social capital . aside from getting in on a sports scholarship you need to know how to navigate the requirements and expectations . its not something you can wake up your senior year of high school and say , yeah i want to go to yale . it takes years of efforts to be accepted and the only way you know what those efforts are early enough is if you have someone in your social circle ie socioeconomic class that can guide you . this is obviously most often your parents . there are obvious exceptions but pretending ivy league schools and phd programs are accessible to the vast majority of people is ludicrous and very ignorant .	d3e7i39	Economics

up to a point . in the bigger buildings maintenance is actually cheaper for rentals . they can and do buy things in bulk and that helps lower the costs . having a permanent maintenance person who understands the buildings personality can also be done at a lower cost . yes the profit part is there and that needs to be paid but at the same time if one had bought apple or google with the same money 10 years ago who would have been ahead ? i 'm calling out some stocks on that because if one buys a house is some places it 's not going to be a good return if at all to it 's a similar risk . if one were to leverage their bet in the stock market just like housing they could make even more . if one gets a new job one has to sell the place or else they get another job of renting and from a distance that can be costly and risky . if one has to sell it after only owning it for a few years just the buying and selling costs can make it a loss . it 's not as simple as rent vs mortgage . it 's more complicated .	d6uwrkv	Economics

i would suggest that modern organic farming or permaculture present a more reasonable alternative to industrial agriculture than premodern subsistence farming . but that 's not the point i was making , which is that continuous economic growth and the increasing consumption that accompanies it which was enabled by developments such as industrial agriculture obviously has a detrimental effect on the earth 's environmental systems . percapita numbers are irrelevant because subsistence farming would not support anything close to today 's levels of populationproductionconsumption . nor does the environment care how many people it takes to destroy it . it is certainly plausible that free trade and the increasing efficiency it may have led to would be relevant in a world with a dramatically smaller population , but our reality today belies the notion that free trade and its corresponding economic growth given the levels of consumption they have led to have had anything but a net negative effect on the environment .	d9hpbw1	Economics

wages appear to be rising ? maybe by today 's ridiculously low standards . i do n't consider beating inflation by 0.02 a real win . wages beat inflation by over 1 in the past year , actually . all measures showed 1 if i recall . 2.2 increase in wages , 1 increase in cpi , wages went up 1.2 . core cpi kept pace with wages , but core cpi excludes energy and food which every american pays for , so it does n't tell us about how much more money people made overall than inflation . so you were off by an order of magnitude and then some . you also do n't seem to be considering that fact that this pathetic wage growth is during a time of unprecedented fiscal stimulus . fiscal stimulus has actually not been a thing . we have n't had a serious fiscal stimulus package since obama entered office , and overall government spending minus entitlements has actually been stagnant , growing slower than inflation . we have a fiscal contractionary policy in practice , it looks like . it 's like the federal reserve just dropped a nuclear bomb on a horde of zombies and they 're still coming . they 've got no other weapons . this is monetary stimulus , not fiscal . the fed handles monetary policy . the federal government handles fiscal . that 's the broad outlines . the monetary stimulus we had that was unprecedented is over . we are no longer at zero interest , as the fed raised its target not long ago only 25 basis points , but still . we stopped qe , so that 's not happening . in actuality the fed is trying to tighten monetary policy , it 's no longer at its most expansionary by far . by the way former fed chairman ben bernanke had an excellent post on the tools still available to the fed here URL , not sure if the next parts are up yet but check it out . we never even went into negative rates in nominal terms , anyways , we did in real terms i believe , which the ecb and boj have done among others . they 're the ones doing the real unprecedented stuff . we did some unprecedented stuff for us but that 's already done . fiscal policy is what 's needed . thinking that global weakness wo n't spread is probably the most puzzling of your statements it has spread . it is already reflected in current trends . the only way for it to make our economy worse is for it to be longer lasting or worse than we expect it to get , since expectations already priced the slowdown into the market and projections . i do n't think that 's a serious issue , we already have been in this global weakness for awhile and the fed has acted appropriately to avoid raising rates further though some believe it should cut rates back and maybe consider negative rates . the federal reserve has been saying for two month that the only reason they are n't raising interest rates is world weakness '' . ok ? the fed is also noting the ongoing wage growth , higher than expected q4 gdp growth , and strong job market . it is waiting to raise further , this is true . but does that mean we 're on a negative trend ? no , gdp is still positive after adjusting for inflation , so is job growth after adjusting for new entries , and so are wages . right now the situation of global weakness just means things are getting better at a slower rate than otherwise . it does n't mean they 're getting worse . you ca n't have it both ways , an economy that 's good enough to pump out new jobs and high wages while at the same time the federal reserve is unable to raise interest rates past 0.25 about 0.19 in real terms . it just does n't add up . i do n't think this logic applies to the real economy .	d1l88yg	Economics

is that an obvious comparison ? a 6.5x increase over 25 years is comparable to a 10x increase over the course of months or a single year ? we never increased our money supply by 10x in a few months . it increased by at most 4.8x over 5.5 years . compare japan 's 6.5x with 0.4 inflation .

i 've read that the new deal prolonged the depression due to massive government intervention in the economy . the regime uncertainty then and now means businesses had a harder time doing longterm planning since they did n't know how the government would meddle in their industry going forward . look at the depression of 192021 very sharp and steep decline followed by immediate swift recovery . not ideal as far as the depths of the pain , but the recovery was what all government policy should strive for . what was that policy in 1920 ? nothing . the government did nothing and the economy roared back . unfortunately that approach has not been tried again . instead you get the keynesians coming out with we definitely did n't do enough '' every time a recovery is sluggish .	d7t5p26	Economics

but walmart generally comes into a town and decimates the job market . so ? automobiles decimated the horse and buggy market . refrigeration decimated the ice market . amazon decimated the bookstore market . the jobs wal mart replaced were also not some highpaying jobs . mom and pops did not pay better . did you know that walmart shut down its butcher department when the butchers tried to unionize ? yeah , the next day the entire company 's butcher department was laid off and shut down , just to avoid a union . in california , they built an entire store and just before it opened the employees tried to unionize . that store never opened . so ? it is perfectly consistent to support the right for workers to form a union and to also support a company to shut down a store or department if they think it would harm their business model . do n't tell me walmart is good for the economy . it is a boon . its a fucking leach . you have it backwards . you say people choose to shop there , but they do n't . they shop there because they ca n't afford to support small business . because small businesses charge higher prices . so you want people to pay more for the products they purchase meaning they can afford less ? so you see , its an endless cycle . the poor shop at walmart because they 're poor because they work at places like walmart . only 1 million people work retail at wal mart . they have 100 million customers a week . so your logic is completely false . but people like you are conditioned to think they are vastly cheaper because they pay like shit but they are n't vastly cheaper and cheaper companies pay more . then those companies should be able to attract higher quality workers and outcompete wal mart .	d2uh4mq	Economics

some background on this . the initiative aims to turn the creation of money in a government task , rather than the task of commercial banks . but the actual motion that has been accepted by parliament does n't mention money creation at all , it just mentions banking regulations , the possibility of starting a purely digital bank , and the ability of citizens to save money at a risk free bank . it does n't mention money creation anywhere . what it could refer to is one of the banks that is still in government hands as a result of great recession bailouts , sns bank , but the bank is never mentioned by name nor is there any reference to a government bank in the accepted motion . the only thing that has been decided on by parliament is that further research needs to be conducted on the issues mentioned above , which could include the benefits of keeping sns bank stateowned with the purpose of offering a riskfree savings bank . our current government is opposed to the money creation idea based on 1 a lack of broad international support , 2 the advantages of the system change are too uncertain to take the plan seriously . the government is also opposed to keeping sns in state hands on the medium term , stating that banking is n't a government task . without government support , no majority in parliament . besides the current coalition cda and d66 are also opposed to both ideas making it extremely unlikely that any of it will happen on the short to medium term . to conclude , the headline is false there is no serious discussion on a sovereign monetary system and there probably wo n't be a state bank as a public utility that part of the headline is n't false outright , research might happen but there is just no political support to put such a plan in action .	d1nwvkh	Economics

'' second , although the article implies that something has changed i.e. , seven years after the great recession '' implies that things were different before the great recession , the article presents no evidence that this is the case . and it 's not clear at all that it is the case ... 30 years ago , people with a ba in history were n't working as historians , and people with a ba in philosophy were n't opening philosophy stores . what is true , and what the article dances around , is that people with those degrees are making significantly more than people without college degrees , particularly if you look at them midcareer and later . people without specialized degrees do tend to take a while to find professional jobs . median income for a household in the us is 54k . median midcareer income for a person not a household with a ba in english is 65k for a person with a ba in philosophy it 's 82k . those are n't bad salaries , even though median midcareer salaries for engineers are , of course , higher .	d86eyfb	Economics

half of what you posted is regarding the simple idea that businesses would make nonoptimal decisions valuing short term returns over greater long term returns if capital gains taxes were increased , due to investors having certain high expectations on how much aftertax returns they get . your answers smell like obfuscation . i feel like you are not being critical about your own idea , but rather are just looking to support your idea only . i think if you try to be critical of it , you 'll see it as weak too . i mean , since when does the investor get to decide what returns he gets ? should n't he always want more ? and why does he suddenly care less about long term returns ? why , if taxes were lowered , would n't his earnings expectations increase it sounds pretty arbritrary so far ? what about the broad changes in average priceearnings ratios that occur across the markets over time ? how does that affect investor expectations ? do investors care about dividends but not equity , or they do not value long term prospects in evaluating prices ? and what does an investor do with his money if he 's not happy with returns ? invest in another company and then still end up paying the same higher tax ? what would it even mean for a company to focus on short term gains ? you mean like the things we 've seen with executives trying meet the terms of their poorly conceived bonus conditions so they cook the books or cut valuable staff in areas that look like costs only but actually are valuable in an more indirect way like service , quality control ? surely that is a problem with the executive bonus structures . but getting off this topic , the other main point you stated is that we are supplyconstrained or resources constrained no , just because the central bank prints money does n't magically pop resources back to be invested . that is pulling real resources away from consumption . resources can either be saved and invested or consumed . you do n't get to consume resources for no opportunity cost just because the central bank prints money . what resources are constrained ? we have excess human labor available , doing nothing because the current workforce can produce and meet the needs of everyone who has the money and desire to spend . whatever resource you think is in shortage can probably be produced by this available labor , no ? i mean , if consumption increases , do you think businesses will start hiring more and expanding to meet the demand , or will they say we ca n't do it , we do n't have the resources ?

they end up paying about half the tax a british citizen making the same salary would in the uk . sinister ? probably not . a very significant tax savings compared to the general populace ? undeniably . well , to consider is that most uk nationals who work for the eu live and work outside the uk , so they would n't be liable for uk income tax anyway . similarly , if they worked for a french company in france or a senegalese company in senegal , they would pay income tax to those countries according to the local tax legislation , not the uk . it would also be the same if they worked for the un and its institutions . the slight growth eu countries are experiencing may , or may not , be highly reflective of eu economic policies . if it does reflect eu policies , then i would say the eu is dysfunctional . we do n't really know , but the following is true weak positive growth across the eu countries is not a very compelling reason to stay there 's sweden 2015 4,2 , ireland 7,8 , czech republic 4,2 , etc . with more than healthy growth . norway , switzerland , and iceland are all examples of developed european countries that are not part of the eu and doing at least as well or better than eu countries . norway , switzerland , and iceland are all rather special cases . nevertheless , norway and iceland are almost as good as being members , as they are in the eta and are bound to follow eu legislation . norway is even in the schengen agreement . however , norway has oil , iceland is a country of 300 000 people , and switzerland is a big tax haven in the middle of the europe with trade agreements with the eu , which is obviously enticing for international companies and individuals .	d499r93	Economics

why does it matter if deflation is bad or not ? if i see something that i think will go up in price because of some sort of deflationary mechanism , it is in my benefit to buy some of it even if it is detrimental to the society at large ... especially if whatever it is can not be stopped . in the case of bitcoin , we do not know when it will become deflationary rate of coins lost rate of coins mined . bitcoin is very far from having any detrimental affect on the economy as a whole . if it was worth 1000x as much as it is today , which is very unlikely , it would have only a minor effect . to have any major impact on the global economy , it would need to grow to at least 10,000x its current price in 2017 dollars which i am sure you would agree is unlikely .	dd402tv	Economics

interesting comment . i think a good starting point to answer this is looking at what makes a good currency and the incentive structures that keep a currency in place . a good currency must be generally accepted , divisible , transportable , scarce and durable . society at present understands that your 20 bill is a medium of exchange , which keeps it accepted , it does n't spoil in the same way as food , or livestock , it fits in your pocket , is in limited supply and can be divided down to a cent which is a low enough and good enough denominator for most transactions . once a currency is in full circulation through an economy it becomes very difficult to displace , as it is essentially a potential conduit for trading every good and service without having to carry those goods around with you and in many cases this acts as an incentive to keep the currency in circulation as its the only way to trade for certain goods and services in modern times it 's unlikely that you can take a goat to walmart and exchange it for 12 eggs , a pint of milk and some bread . once we take this currency as constant , the demand and supply side factors of inflation determine its value as markets do . these factors can be boiled down fairly simply and from your question i 'm guessing you can fill in the rest ? not trying to teach anyone to suck eggs here but i 'm happy to explain further if it 's wanted hope this kind of covers what you were getting at ? tl dr if you did n't know what a dollar was it would be worthless , but once you 're taught what it can be used for it makes sense to keep using it , which makes it a permanent '' fixture and subject to market forces . edit permanent ''	ditfmgc	Economics

author is republican congressman from texas . after five years , doddfrank is a failure the law has crushed small banks , restricted access to credit , and planted the seeds of financial instability . by jeb hensarling july 19 , 2015 550 p.m. et 373 comments tuesday will mark five years since president obama s signing of the doddfrank law , the most sweeping rewrite of the country s financial laws since the new deal . mr. obama told the country that the legislation would lift our economy. the statute itself declared that it would end too big to fail and promote financial stability. none of that has come to pass . toobigtofail institutions have not disappeared . big banks are bigger , small banks are fewer , and the financial system is less stable . meanwhile , the economy remains in the doldrums . doddfrank was based on the premise that the financial crisis was the result of deregulation . yet george mason university s mercatus center reports that regulatory restrictions on financial services grew every year between 19992008. it wasn t deregulation that caused the crisis , it was dumb regulation . among the dumbest were washington s affordablehousing mandates , beginning in 1977 , that led to a loosening of underwriting standards and put people into homes they couldn t afford . the federal reserve played its part in the 2008 financial crisis by keeping interest rates too low for too long , inflating the housing bubble . washington not only failed to prevent the crisis , it led us into it . doddfrank was supposedly aimed at wall street , but it hit main street hard . community financial institutions , which make the bulk of small business loans , are overwhelmed by the law s complexity . government figures indicate that the country is losing on average one community bank or credit union a day . before doddfrank , 75 of banks offered free checking . two years after it passed , only 39 did soa trend various scholars have attributed to doddfrank s durbin amendment , which imposed price controls on the fee paid by retailers when consumers use a debit card . bank fees have also increased due to doddfrank , leading to a rise of the unbanked and underbanked among low and moderateincome americans . has doddfrank nevertheless made the financial system more secure ? many of the threats to financial stability identified in the latest report of doddfrank s financial stability oversight council are primarily the result of the law itself , along with other government policies . doddfrank s volcker rule banning proprietary trading by banks , and other postcrisis regulatory mandates , has drastically reduced liquidity for making markets in fixedincome assets . the corporate bond market is one of the primary channels for capital formation in the economy . reduced liquidity in this market amplifies volatility . because of doddfrank , financial markets will have less capacity to deal with shocks and are more likely to seize up in a panic . many economists believe this could be the source of the next financial crisis . doddfrank s scheme for regulating derivatives markets concentrates systemic risks into clearinghouses and then designates the clearinghouses as too big to fail . doddfrank s orderly liquidation authority enshrines taxpayerfunded bailouts into law . meanwhile , the fed , by keeping interest rates too low for too long , is introducing dangerous imbalances into financial markets and is likely inflating asset bubbles . what is most disturbing about doddfrank is the authority it gives bureaucrats to control huge swaths of the economy . the director of the consumer financial protection bureau , an agency created by doddfrank , can declare any consumercredit product unfair or abusive and outlaw it . oversight ? cfpb funding is not subject to congressional appropriations , and doddfrank requires courts to grant the bureau deference regarding its interpretation of federal consumerfinancial law . doddfrank requires that bank holding companies worth 50 billion or more must submit a living will to the federal deposit insurance corp. and the fed . this will is a detailed plan for how the company will cope in case of severe financial problems . if the plan is not to the regulators liking , they can require the company to restructure , raise capital , divest or downsize . the heightened prudential supervision doddfrank allows the fed to exercise over systemically important banks essentially places them under government control . soon the fed may exercise effective control over the largest insurance companies and asset managers as well . after aig and ge capital were designated systemically important , fed officials , according to a financial times story last august , became de facto board members of the firms , involving themselves in decisions including whether employees should be fired or disciplined . before doddfrank s passage , former sen. chris dodd said that no one will know until this is actually in place how it works. today we know . the law he cowrote with former rep. barney frank is gradually turning america s largest financial institutions into functional utilities and taking the power to allocate capitalthe lifeblood of the u.s. economyaway from the free market and delivering it to political actors in washington . five years ago , house republicans offered the consumer protection and regulatory enhancement act as an alternative to doddfrank . it sought to restore market discipline , end taxpayer bailouts and protect consumers with innovative , competitive markets policed for fraud and deception . it s time to revisit the ideas in that bill , offer new ones and replace doddfrank . mr. hensarling , a republican congressman from texas , is chairman of the house financial services committee .	deigb93	Economics

even when all levels of tax revenue sources are taken into account , we still use more progressive methods than most other countries . URL for example , the average oecd reliance on income and profits taxes is 34 percent of the total revenues . the us uses these for 49 percent of revenues . we rely much more on property taxes generally progressive and much less on sales and vat taxes generally regressive . where are you getting that the poor paid more taxes ? everyone 's rates minus the top quintile went down after the last major tax reform in 1986. the top 1 's went up 6 . if you want to blame someone for taxes on the poor , take it up with fdr . he 's the reason we have a payroll tax , and why when social security was reformed in the mid 80 's those were the taxes to fund it . even though there 's a 750 billion annual mismatch between payroll taxes and the programs they fund , we still ca n't get rid of this notion that these are pension programs rather than welfare programs .	droc4pj	Economics

median household income in 1999 was 40,201 nominally , not 57k it is lower if you use ipd to calculate it . not sure what point you 're trying to make here , census uses cpi for inflation calculations . they changed the income questions because it was giving inaccurate data they were trying to get more accurate data . which means you ca n't compare prior years in establishing trends because they 're different measurements . that 's why the graph has a discontinuity . it 's like if you measured average height and then added an offset for average shoe thickness to account for a past oversight . it would n't mean people are suddenly shorter by the offset . you should also note that 20122013 was not a particularly large gain , despite implementing the new questions , indicating that the data was n't really massively different , at least at that point . the changes were not fully phased in until 2014. so the the two years you claim represent such stunning growth were in fact the first two years of these altered measurements . it 's absurd the first full year of changes resulted in the largest yoy increase in income ever recorded by the census survey .	do9eena	Economics

well would you like to argue why this is a good decision ? i believe this is a bad decisions based on the following heavy student loan debts in an economy decreases the amount of disposable income a person has , which ends up meaning less goods purchased in an economy , which also means less than the potential amounts of jobs created and less investments in an economy . you may say mortgages do the same thing but the difference is that people tend to get mortgages later in life when they are ready to settle down and after they got the partying out of the system . the thing about student loans is that it decreases the disposable income from people who have a higher propensity to consume , when the students pay off the loans , they will be much older and they will have to start planning for their retirements , so every student who went through university would not be used to hisher maximum potential in economical terms . people are not up voting this because its something negative about the current administration , they are up voting this post to spread awareness of a bad economic policy .	dgmcz5t	Economics

i 've been hearing short termism '' for a while , and i 've never really understood the concept . my impression of the story is that shareholders push managers to make decisions which generate higher shortterm earnings ? profits ? dividends ? at the expense of longterm earnings ? profits ? efficiency ? . that sounds like a good definition . when does it make sense ? in this context , we should think of a firm as maximizing a stream of discounted profits . the question becomes when is it true that maximizing the sum of discounted profits '' is not the same as maximizing profits period by period '' ? if periods say , quarters are independent , then the two problems are the same , and shorttermism '' is a meaningless concept . however , internal reinvestment generates tradeoffs . specifically , the firm could able to reduce dividend payouts today , invest in capital or r d , or ... , then generate higher dividends tomorrow . optimality occurs when the entire discounted present value dividend stream is maximized . if shareholders and managers have different horizons or have different discount factors , then shareholders could demand higher dividends in the current period at the expense of future periods . this would be suboptimal over the lifetime of the firm , but might not be suboptimal for a shareholder who is only invested for a single period .	di613ds	Economics

thanks for the working paper . it really was an interesting read . although the gmu 's mercatus center 's views on this matter are well understood , i 'd have to say that claiming that appointment power has been used to influence monetary policy '' is about as forceful of a case as claiming that appointment power has been used to influence constitutional jurisprudence '' , since the same procedure is used for establishing supreme court justices but many do americans presumably consider judicial branch independence to be a thing . the other main argument is that the correlation between changes in in senate banking committee heads with monetary policy establishes that the legislative branch has influence over monetary policy . does it ? did they compare monetary policy and senate banking committee heads with american business cycles ? because correlation does n't imply the direction of causality , presence or absence of endogeneity , or whether causation actually flows from a third factor in this case , the business cycle . lastly , looking at just one first world country albeit one that occasionally tries to politicize monetary policy is n't really much of a challenge to cb independence as a legal concept , such much as it 's a challenge to america 's institutional capability to understand and implement modern legal rule of law standards . while it 's true that policy makers in the first world constantly try to chip away at cb independence especially in the us , it is n't zimbabwe . and it is n't venezuela . no sense in pretending otherwise .	dpysg5v	Economics

this is an important fact that you seem to be ignoring as you are only focusing on extreme scenarios of a complete replacement of human labor . the question being addressed is whether a ubi is good because of impending total mass unemployment , which is a common belief on reddit . every indication seems to be that the trend of higher paying jobs to be replaced by lower paying ones as new technology comes into play will continue the evidence points to the total opposite , sbtc is the hot issue of today . it is n't the highly skilled who lose out . you seem to be focusing mostly on unemployment rather than underemployment . that is the debate i was having . if you want a different debate , fine , but do n't act like i was not addressing the argument actually being had . but the fact remains that automation is a factor in reducing the ability of labor to provide for households and individuals technological change is the greatest driver in higher wealth and incomes . i take it you are n't in favour of smashing spinning jennys . it is structural and this trend will only get worse structural actually has a meaning , one which you seem to be misusing . go to the data on u3 and u6 and try to argue your point . sure , new jobs may be created as automation continues , but chances are these jobs will be lower paying less stable than the ones they are replacing , and hence the middle class will find it harder and harder to maintain a standard of living on labor alone , as they traditionally have done . which is a popular topic of discussion among the same economists who futurists dismiss . funny that . so if you want to keep your arguments for ubi grounded in reality it would be helpful to acknowledge the reality which already exists unemployment u6 is lower than it was in 1997 , it 's at its precrisis level . higher unemployment is extremely cyclical , not structural . if you want to argue about the merits of a ubi you are doing yourself a terrible disservice if you fail to include the trends we are seeing in labor markets due to automation . ha .	div4y0p	Economics

it 's kinda complicated , but the upshot is that the federal government ca n't just create money . it has to borrow it if it wants to spend it , and does n't have enough income . so it borrows money in a variety of ways , but generally through issuing treasuries '' . you can go to URL and buy some yourself if you want . these treasury notes , bills and bonds will give you back the money you paid for them , plus some additional money generally every six months until they come to maturity , which varies depending on the term of the treasury from less than a year up to 30 years . the difference between the face value and the sum of the payments it makes over the life of the treasury is what it costs the gov't to borrow the money . those rates are generally pretty low because us debt is about as secure an investment as you can make more risk more potential profit . in fact , the rates have been so low recently that there have been times when bonds are running below the expected inflation rate it 's actually cheaper to borrow money today than just spend what the gov't would take in in taxes and spend that money at some future point . the gov't is constantly issuing this debt and retiring old debt , basically refinancing the national debt as bonds become due . there 's a whole additional bunch of complexity with what happens to those bonds once they are sold the us gov't actually holds a good chunk of it itself , and the federal reserve an additional chunk of it , but that 's the basics of it anyway .	dfg8jwa	Economics

that s not exactly right , reason being that if they got a paycheck and reinvested it the loophole wouldn t work . the paycheck comes from the fund , which is structured as a partnership , and income maintains its character for tax purposes when passed along to the partners . so because the management fee comes out of the returns on the investments , that s the basis for arguing that they maintain their character as capital gains . it s a stupid loophole because the logic falls apart when there are no returns , but to get around that just requires that the management fee have a certain element of entrepreneurial risk to it , i.e . no returns means no management fee , so in theory getting a guaranteed management fee while failing to make returns for the fund should be classified as ordinary income . whether or not that s how it plays out in reality is anyone s guess , because we don t get to see the fund agreements or tax returns needed to make those determinations .	e76a4vg	Economics

first off , you are including a lot of series for construction and manufacturing , which are about 5 and 8 of jobs . it really does n't tell us much to look at small sectors like that , and we would n't expect there to be any relationship to economy wide productivity for them . second , the multifactor productivity series actually uses the ipd . per the technical documentation URL real gross domestic product in the business and nonfarm business sectors is the basis of the output components of the major sector labor productivity and multifactor productivity measures . the output measures for private business and private nonfarm business are similar to the fisherideal indexes of output for business and nonfarm business except that output of government enterprises is omitted . so pce gets closer , but still wo n't match . and your graph still shows compensation rising faster than productivity for the almost matched employees nonfarm business , and shows hourly earnings for p ns only a little behind . finally , business and employees do n't barter , so not sure what you mean there . employees get paid out of the sales of the output they produce , they get paid wages . but wages ca n't rise more rapidly than the value of the output produced on a sustained basis , because any time that happened profits would be falling . the money to pay the employees has to come from somewhere . see this paper URL from dean baker , for example . also , there are other adjustments that really need to be made , included in that paper . look where he starts at figure one , showing the typical graph that suggests wages are growing less than productivity , then describes why it really is n't accurate while the picture in figure 1 is dramatic , it is somewhat misleading . real wages could not possibly keep pace with the measured rate of productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector without a substantial redistribution from profits to wages . there are three main reasons why this is the case . first , the nonfarm business sector is not the whole economy . wages for workers in the economy as a whole can only increase as quickly as productivity in the economy as a whole . second , productivity measures the rate of growth of gross output , not net output . the difference between gross and net output is the capital equipment and software that wear out or become obsolete . the share of output that goes to depreciation has actually been growing rapidly in recent years , which means that there has been a large gap between the growth in gross output and net output . finally , output and real wages are measured using different deflators . in order to determine whether workers are getting their share of productivity gains , it is necessary to use the same deflator for both output and wage growth . look at the adjustments he makes 1. he adjusts for lower growth in the remainder of the economy not in the nonfarm business sector 2. he adjusts for the difference between gross and net output 3. he adjusts so that both series are using the same deflator same as i 've been doing 4. he uses total compensation , rather than wages as i did 5. he adjusts to compare using economy wide compensation rather than just p ns so that he is comparing the same workers because i have n't done 1 2 here , even my graphs were still overstating productivity growth . if you do those adjustments , and compare average or aggregate compensation , the gap pretty much dissappears . if you are interested in highlighting income inequality though , then you can use median wages , and figure 5 in that paper is a good way to do that . but then , i 'm not sure why we 're even comparing to productivity , at that point . if the point is just to highlight wage inequality , why not just compare the median wages to the average ? dean baker has a specific point he is making , in the end in short , the economy has seen a sharp upward redistribution of income over the last three decades with little obvious growth dividend . policies that redistribute income upward , yet fail to increase growth , are very costly to the vast majority of the u.s. labor force . that 's a good point , and it touches on productivity , but the point there , that productivity growth has been low , is n't made that clear by that graph . and the point about upward redistribution is best made by comparing median and average wages and wealth directly .	e4mclhw	Economics

it 's not a matter of methodological flaw . luck won out by definition . let me explain . in the model , each agent receives a talent and luck variable from a normal distribution , then encounters 80 events that are randomly lucky , if random pluck , or unlucky , if random pluck . in a lucky event , the individual doubles his capital if random ptalent , else unchanged . in an unlucky event , the individual halves his capital . first , i observe that the effect of talent is asymmetric in this model the modelers assume that talent has no impact in unlucky situations . that 's a weird assumption , right ? it does n't make sense that talented people are no better than untalented people at mitigating the effects of bad luck . another questionable assumption here is that talent is a low pass filter . that is , when you have luck , you either double your money or you do n't . would it not make more sense to consider that the return to luck is larger with greater talent ? a third thing i think is that talent in the real world is often claimed to be about creating a chance to get lucky . that is , the model is perhaps inverted from how things actually work . perhaps talent should come first in the model in each trial , we would first check whether our talent value gave us a chance at lucky , or a chance at unlucky , and then luck would determine whether that event actually happened . these are all minor edits to this model that significantly increase the impact of talent . the modelers wanted to create a model where luck is dominant , but it 's just as easy to create a model where talent is dominant , or one where talent and luck share primacy .	dz34b94	Economics

here 's a public version of the debt traps '' article URL most interesting part is the speculation as to why people might get back in debt this may happen for several reasons . critically , we are able to rule out one key hypothesis vendors have sufficiently lucrative investment opportunities that sustained borrowing is profit maximizing . there are many more possible mechanisms , and no doubt no single one explains everyone s reversion . thus disentangling and assessing the relative importance of each would require more observations and data than afforded by our sample , but we explore several possibilities and consider these fruitful areas for further study . for example , the vendors may be susceptible to unavoidable consumption and income shocks that force them to return to borrowing . vendors may suffer from selfcontrol problems such as present bias . vendors may not have access to a reliable savings technology . finally , vendors may not understand the longterm cost of repeated borrowing at high interest rates .	dtrviga	Economics

the major problem with japan was n't just that conventional leverage was at play , but that and the point i am making regarding asset bubbles and leverage is that the japanese and many investors simply believed that a new asset appreciation paradigm was at play . i do n't know how old you are , but back then , people were convinced that the japanese were going to rule the world look who 's in charge in blade runner , for example . i agree that the west was infested with numbers of weeaboos not seen again until crunchyroll started webcasting . i remember everyone talking about japanese manufacturing processes and japanese management techniques constantly . i also agree that valuation of japanese assets became divorced from all reality . that said , in order to create contagion and widespread economic failure , you need banks to be neck deep in the crisis . if there 's no leverage , then the popping of an asset bubble just results in some people , mostly rich ones , becoming less rich . in order to create a depression , you need money to stop flowing , and that means you need banks to feel shaky about their portfolios . prices going up and down are a crucial function of a free market and economy . asset prices and inflation rates ca n't go up forever simply because it is good for the economy '' . and believe it or not , deflation after periods of extraordinary price appreciation if a healthy phenomenon , not one that should be prevented at all costs as we are presently seeing and saw in japan for the past 25 years . when we discuss inflation and deflation , we 're not talking about asset prices . we 're talking about the purchasing power of money in terms of goods and services . it 's not alarming for a dollar to buy 25 more equity , but it is alarming for a dollar to buy 25 more rice . we have n't seen a big runup in inflation , and even if we had i would n't say it would be wise policy to target deflation . china is run by an authoritarian , corrupt regime that has grossly rewarded its ccp innercore thanks to its previous and diminishing labor market competitive advantage . add on how the chinese market is inherently racist han chinese apparently have some sort of racebased gift to be able to really own businessesproperty , dare i mention citizenship , anticompetitive especially to foreigners but also to outofcircle ccp chinese , and full of ip theft , graft , corruption and brute state driven force disappearing people , including their own ceos . china has little to nothing to offer to freemarket minded economists other than a lesson of how a public balance sheet can help promote incredible crony capitalism . well , obviously china is far from perfect , but i view that you can still learn things from chinese success . they 've demonstrated the possibility that state owned enterprises can be used as instruments of policy and coexist with high economic growth . there 's also a good argument that allocating more public expenditure to infrastructure and less to social support is better for long run living standards . china 's sovereign wealth fund also demonstrates the potential of combining international politics and economics . the last thing i think is interesting to examine is that the chinese response to the financial crisis seemingly irrational building of ghost towns , and that seems to have been remarkably effective at maintaining chinese living standards chinese per capita gdp barely budged as economies fell left and right . the 4.5t balance sheet that will have to continue to actually purchase assets while unwinding qe '' would like to have a say about the rubber hitting the road '' . the last unconventional policy decision taken was qe3 in 2012. that was still at a time when it could be credibly argued that strange times call for strange actions . at the moment , the fed is trying to figure out how to get back to regular order without breaking stuff it 's not an easy task . the ecb 's use of negative rates is a blatant coverup for the structural disaster that the eu has become . the pigs members have done little to nothing to truly reform their corrupt , broken and nontax paying selfs all while italy can borrow 10 yr debt at lower rates than the us government . if this is a coverup , it 's the worst i 've ever seen . approximately everyone knows the periphery is a fiscal hazmat zone . japan has spent over 25 years trying its best to employ accommodation policies that have put off the shortterm pain of recovering from a bubble primarily driven by political pressures and cronyism . i am afraid that today 's cb polices are similarly rooted and are n't being enacted in the best interest of the average citizen . i think central bank policy is not generally aimed at the interest of the average citizen . focusing in on the fed , their dual mandate is full employment and price stability . arguably the thing that average people want most is rising wages , but rising wages is scary for both parts of the mandate . higher wages tend to reduce employment and are a primary driver of inflation . so when the fed sees workers getting what they want , they act to slow the economy .	dw57t2j	Economics

i was reading some years ago about 'positive ' versus 'negative ' corruption which made me wonder about how the effects of corruption are calculated . iirc with positive corruption public funds are stolen and then invested into productive pursuits by the people who embezzle the money such as building a factory , and with negative corruption the money is sent outside the country or spent on unproductive activities . if anything , however , corruption does signal that there are problems with the way things are being done that may not simply be the presence of corrupt people . police may take bribes not because they are especially corrupt but because they are underpaid , for example .	ebhp23o	Economics

due to the pay wall i did n't see the article so perhaps this was addressed in it . the first thing to consider is pay . labor basically does n't have any negotiating power these days so the only people that control the income are the business owners . if they do n't offer enough people wo n't come . i 'm a pennsylvania resident and i recently considered going back to school to teach . we have a teacher shortage so why not ? well , because the pay sucks . i was informed that starting pay is around 35,000 annual . you can make more money without a degree . then there are the job skills needed . many jobs used to do on the job training . not anymore . i recall hearing one business owner on 60 minutes rather bluntly state it 's not my job to train people '' . if an area lacks the proper ecosystem for job training then it kind of kills the labor market . it 's not an accident that so many silicon valley coders are from near by stanford . the other big thing is that economic models are n't guarantees of behavior . capital should offer more pay , signing bonuses , and be more aggressive in hiring practices but that does n't mean they will . before the french revolution really took off there was a famine in france that devastated wheat production . many people died but they did n't have to . a new plant from the new world '' would have been a good substitute had the people been more willing to try , the potato . it 's arguable that had the french people been more willing to try then many would have lived and perhaps the french revolution might not have happened .	dwnfi5t	Economics
why have n't they what ? you 're still lumping together funds that , say , take large stakes in a small number of companies and try to actually change how the company is managed and , often end up with market beta close to or above 1 with funds trying to have zero net market exposure at all times which ... should do worse than the market generally but not be very correlated to it with several things in between . and you might be lumping those in with funds that literally just sell insurance to insurance companies and funds that buy positivetrending indexes and commodities and sell negativetrending ones and funds that exploit pricing discrepancies between different parts of the capital structure of a given company convertible bonds vs regular bonds and stock , for example . and again , the question is not whether a hf allocation will outperform your equity allocation or your fixed income allocation for that matter . it 's much closer to whether 54 stocks 36 bonds 10 hfs beats 6040 . and ... well , that depends heavily on what goes into that 10 , and even if you do use a broad hf index which . again . does n't represent a typical institutional hf allocation . it still has more to do with its equity correlation than its own return vs equities .	dspcexo	Economics

i do n't have credibility to explain why so heres an article URL URL when the economy is not running at capacity , meaning there is unused labor or resources , inflation theoretically helps increase production . more dollars translates to more spending , which equates to more aggregated demand . more demand , in turn , triggers more production to meet that demand . famous british economist john maynard keynes URL believed that some inflation was necessary to prevent the paradox of thrift . '' if consumer prices are allowed to fall consistently because the country is becoming too productive , consumers learn to hold off their purchases to wait for a better deal . the net effect of this paradox is to reduce aggregate demand URL , leading to less production , layoffs and a faltering economy . inflation also makes it easier on debtors , who repay their loans with money that is less valuable than the money they borrowed . this encourages borrowing and lending , which again increases spending on all levels . perhaps most important to the federal reserve is that the u.s. government is the largest debtor URL in the world , and inflation helps soften the blow of its massive debt . economists once believed in a real inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment , and that rising unemployment could be fought with increased inflation . this relationship was defined in the famous phillips curve URL . the phillips curve was largely discredited in the 1970s , however , when the u.s. experienced stagflation , '' or high levels of inflation and rising unemployment at the same time thought to be impossible at the time .	e3n7f66	Economics

i have some issues with this , so i 'll just walk through them one by one it says median household income is only up 5.3 since 2008 and remains well below where it was in 1998 this is quite plainly false , median household income in 2016 was 59,039 in 2016 dollars , median household income in 1998 was 57,248 in 2016 dollars and this was notably during a bubble that burst . URL curiously the authors did n't use 1999 when income was higher but still below 2016 levels it makes the claim that wages are n't rising , but currently wages are rising rapidly URL . i 'm not saying you have to credit anyone with this , or that there have n't been long term issues with wage growth in the us and the developed world in general , but those occurred more from 20002015 than today , so i 'm not sure why that would be predictive of a crash today ... it also says about one in five u.s. jobs still pays a median income below the federal poverty line . which is a fairly strange phrasing , and i suspect its because our poverty rate is per household not per person , and 14 of people live in households below the poverty line . if a teenager is employed at a job that pays relatively little , of course they have a job that would pay an income below the poverty line , but that does n't really matter because they are not below the poverty line . in general the article seems unaware that interest rates are being increased by the fed , not decreased . it is worth mentioning that the administration is attempting a risky strategy of running the economy hot '' by stimulating it during a boom , in an apparent effort to increase the labor force participation rate . this is a risky strategy but it is not as outside the mainstream as it may seem . many economists have advocated in recent years for a target inflation rate of 4 to try to boost lackluster growth and increase labor force participation .	dy4ryz0	Economics

three years ago , the steel mill outside the small city of smederevo , serbia , appeared headed for the scrap heap . the serbian government , which owned the mill , had stopped subsidizing it after six straight years of losses . hemorrhaging cash , it struggled to buy spare parts and raw materials such as iron ore. it was like trying to drive a car without tires , says sinia preli , a union leader at the factory . now production is hitting alltime highs under its new owner , hesteel group , a chinese stateowned steel producer . exports from the plant , which is backed by tens of millions of dollars from chinese state banks and investment funds , are surging . and it has started shipping steel to the u.s. as the trump administration ramps up its fight against chinese steel and commerce secretary wilbur ross ended trade talks with beijing over the weekend without a settlement , u.s. officials are confronting a strategic shift from china s statebacked manufacturers . for the past several years , they have been shutting production at home and expanding overseas , fueled by tens of billions of dollars from chinese stateowned lenders and funds . by owning production abroad , chinese steelmakers aim to gain largely unfettered access to global markets . their factories back in china are constrained by steep tariffs imposed by the u.s. and numerous other countrieslargely before president donald trump took officeto stop chinese steelmakers from dumping excess production onto world markets . but their factories outside china face few socalled antidumping tariffs . the trump administration in march jolted the global trading system by imposing additional tariffs of 25 on all imported steel and 10 on aluminum , a move aimed at ratcheting up pressure on china to shut domestic steel and aluminum plants . last week , those tariffs were extended to canada , mexico and the european union . the eu is considering its own tariffs to stop metals exports blocked by the u.s. tariffs from flooding into europe . antidumping tariffs . the trump administration in march jolted the global trading system by imposing additional tariffs of 25 on all imported steel and 10 on aluminum , a move aimed at ratcheting up pressure on china to shut domestic steel and aluminum plants . last week , those tariffs were extended to canada , mexico and the european union . the eu is considering its own tariffs to stop metals exports blocked by the u.s. tariffs from flooding into europe . even though the new u.s. tariffs apply to chinese steelmakers that moved production abroad , the moves are still paying off . the trump tariff rate is much lower than existing u.s. antidumping tariffs on steel produced inside china , which often exceeded 200 . a spokesman for hesteel declined to comment . china s ministry of industry and information technology , which oversees the steel and aluminum industries , didn t respond to inquiries . chinese overcapacity has depressed global steel prices and wreaked havoc on china s competitors . after cajoling beijing to cut domestic capacity , western officials have watched with exasperation as chinese companies boost production around the world . and western industry executives worry the overseas investments are helping chinese steelmakers avoid the antidumping tariffs that governments have imposed to protect their companies against allegedly unfair chinese trade practices . china s steelproduction boom took off around the turn of the century as beijing threw its support behind a sector seen as vital to the nation s emergence as a global economic power . the 2008 financial crisis prompted beijing to undertake an economic stimulus program that included the construction of hundreds of new steel plants . chinese steel production rose sevenfold between 2000 and 2013 , when it accounted for half of all global capacity . by 2013 , china s domestic economy was slowing , leading chinese steel and aluminum producers to flood global markets and drive down prices . the average price of chinese steel exports fell by about 50 between 2011 and 2016. governments around the world responded by imposing more than 130 antidumping tariffs against chinese metals manufacturers , mostly on steel , depriving the domestic market of an important outlet . beijing responded by ordering capacity cuts a net of 150 million tons of annual steel capacity is slated to be shut between 2016 and 2020 , as are aluminum plants that were built without government approval . at the same time , in 2014 , the government launched a plan , called international capacity cooperation , that enlisted chinese state financial institutions to help manufacturers add production overseas . analysts and western government and industry officials say chinese manufacturers are receiving hundreds of billions of dollars of state support to build and purchase plants on foreign soil , through money provided by institutions such as china development bank , bank of china and funds like china investment corp. the overseas plants are likely to be tapped as exclusive suppliers for the one belt , one road initiative , beijing s trilliondollar infrastructure plan to project economic influence across eurasia and africa . china is just moving whole industrial clusters to external geographies and then continuing to overproduce steel , aluminum , cement , plate glass , textiles , etc. , says tristan kenderdine , research director at future risk , a consulting firm that tracks china s overseas investments . none of this is economically viable under a supplydemand regime without state subsidies. chinese steel companies have signed agreements to build plants in malaysia , pakistan , india and elsewhere . in northern brazil , a chinese consortium is expected to break ground later this year on an 8 billion project to build one of the world s biggest steel plants , expanding brazil s potential steel output even though the industry there operates at less than 70 of capacity . this is total nonsense , with all the idle capacity that we have , says alexandre lyra , chairman of the brazilian steel institute , which represents brazilian producers . chinese companies also are building new steel mills in indonesia . last year , tsingshan group holdings , a statebacked steel producer based in wenzhou on china s southeastern coast , opened a twomillionton stainlesssteel plant on the indonesian island of sulawesi that accounts for 4 of the world s stainlesssteel production . the mill , built using a 570 million loan from the china development bank , is now pushing down prices from asia to the u.s. , industry executives and analysts say . we are seeing tenders in the area from tsingshan at very , very , competitive prices , miguel ferrandis torres , financial director at stainlesssteel company acerinox , told analysts in april . tsingshan is likely losing money on those shipments from its indonesian plant , mr. torres said . tsingshan declined to comment . tsingshan s product is entering the u.s. through a joint venture with pittsburghbased stainlesssteel producer allegheny technologies inc. the joint venture is restarting a stainlesssteel rolling plant in western pennsylvania that allegheny had shut in 2016 partly because of pressure from inexpensive chinese imports . the new company is importing 300,000 metric tons of semifinished stainlesssteel slabs from tsingshan s indonesian plantreplacing slab allegheny made in a nowclosed production lineand processing them into sheets for products ranging from household appliances to medical equipment . that put downward pressure on u.s. stainlesssteel prices last year , industry executives say . we re moving from being a highcost producer , which we ve been for a while , to being the lowcost producer in the market , robert wetherbee , an allegheny executive , told analysts in november . the trump tariffs that came into force in march hit the stainless steel tsingshan was importing from indonesia to its jointventure plant in pennsylvania . allegheny has asked the trump administration for an exemption from the tariffs on those imports . tsingshan is expanding its indonesian plant , and jiangsu delong , a chinese producer based in jiangsu province , is building another plant nearby . those projects alone will increase global stainlesssteel capacity by 9 from 2017 levels , according to michael finch , a steel analyst at cru group in london , even though the stainlesssteel industry has significant spare capacity . in 2014 , officials from hebei province , a pollutionchoked steelmaking region near beijing , began hunting for overseas investments for the province s most important company hebei iron steel group , renamed hesteel group in 2016. when hebei officials approached the serbian government in 2014 about investment opportunities in the country , belgrade immediately thought of the elezara smederevo steel company , which had a mill on the danube river , say people familiar with the deal .	e05dohh	Economics

it 's not a done deal that single payer is cheaper . that really depends on implementation . much of america 's problem with cost is about american business models and american values . even if single payer is cheaper , it 's not a given that cheaper healthcare is deflationary . if you convert x in public spending and x in private spending into 1.5x in public spending , that still ends up adding inflationary pressure as long as you have n't increased taxes to cover that 0.5x of additional public spending . let 's say there 's 1x in public and 1x in private converted to 1.5x in public spending . maybe healthcare costs specifically increase , but i really do n't see how the overall economy undergoes inflation there . money that was being spent on insurance is being spent on healthcare instead , but the important thing is that less of it is being spent total . overall , i would say that the health care debate in america ought to spend less time considering who pays ? '' and more time considering how much ? '' agree but it is possible to consider both . i would expect providing a deficitfinanced childcare program to be significantly inflationary . not only are you expanding the money supply , but the people you are paying that money to are working class and likely to spend it quickly . some of that money is being transferred away from current childcare programs , what would initially get spent on those workers is now being spent on the government workers . and the whole point of a job guarantee is to ensure that no negative economic impact comes from that shift . i also find that your claim on increased productivity is dubious . in particular , adding single mothers to the workforce generally reduces productivity . single mothers are less skilled than the mean worker , resulting in less output per worker and less wages than the mean worker . average productivity may go down but in this case , with talk of inflation , it 's really only total productivityoutput that matters . infrastructure generally adds productivity , but adding productivity in excess of the cost of the project in monetary expansion is an extremely tall order . deficitfinanced infrastructure is extremely likely to add inflationary pressure . infrastructure is indeed a case where the benefits are n't felt until the future which would probably result in shortterm inflation could be managed with taxes , but a more productive society in the future . i agree that mmt economists generally do a pretty good job explaining their take on money , but those are n't the voices being heard or the messages being run with . many people are hearing that mmt means deficits do n't matter , and if that 's what politicians run with it does n't really matter what economists think . there 's only one sitting member of congress that 's even acknowledged mmt publicly , and when ro khanna did it , he basically implied that his understanding of it came from stephanie kelton who is pretty clear about inflation . khanna also has a background in economics .	dwnlest	Economics

sometimes bribery isn t monetary . sometimes it s in the form of favoritism by putting someone else s project ahead of yours . for example , you have a planning department that will not approve developer 1 s project until developer 2 s project is approved . this delay of the first developer will cause that company to pay far more in interest and delay selling of units in that project . this causes the first developer to lose money and possibly to go bankrupt . the planner may be doing this just because they feel empowered and justify it by deciding that project 2 is more worthy of being developed first . developer 2 may then be able to purchase the project 1 for a discounted price and send the planner on a nice vacation , or buy them a nice boat for that ability to be first . no money changed hands between developer 2 and the planner , but it created economic turmoil . this type of thing happens all the time in my community . the impression that money has to change hands isn t always the case .	ebhxu5e	Economics

in some countries , taxbased policies specifically aimed at reducing ghg emissionsalongside technology and other policieshave helped to weaken the link between ghg emissions and gdp high confidence . in a large group of countries , fuel taxes although not necessarily designed for the purpose of mitigation have effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes table 15.2 . the demand reduction in transport fuel associated with a 1 price increase is 0.6 to 0.8 in the long run , although the shortrun response is much smaller 15.5.2 . in some countries revenues are used to reduce other taxes and or to provide transfers to lowincome groups . this illustrates the general principle that mitigation policies that raise government revenue generally have lower social costs than approaches which do not . while it has previously been assumed that fuel taxes in the transport sector are regressive , there have been a number of other studies since ar4 that have shown them to be progressive , particularly in developing countries medium evidence , medium agreement . 3.6.3 , 14.4.2 , 15.5.2 URL emphasis mine	eftjzm8	Economics

URL see this report that disputes it and seems reputable . the global warming hypothesis with respect to co2 is not based upon the radiative properties of co2 itself , which is a very weak greenhouse gas . it is based upon a small initial increase in temperature caused by co2 and a large theoretical amplification of that temperature increase , primarily through increased evaporation of h2o , a strong greenhouse gas . any comparable temperature increase from another cause would produce the same calculated outcome .

from what i 've learnt the deficit is only harmful once a country is reaching close to full employment , which is where you usually to start to see too much inflation . if unemployment is at 15 , the government should absolutely deficit spend in order to increase employment . but i think it 's also important to note that a deficit and debt are not the same thing . if you imagine just a government and a civilian , and the government pays the civilian 10 to build a road , and then taxes back 3 in the process , the government will have accumulated a deficit of 7 while the civilian will have accumulated a surplus of the exact same amount . someone 's deficit must equal someone else 's surplus , and visa versa . does this mean that the government owes someone 7 ? no . it 's just a record of what they 've spent and have n't taxed back , which is why they do n't need to print '' money in order to pay it back bonds are a different conversation . they could tax it back completely from the civilianprivate sector , but this would n't achieve anything .	euyipg2	Economics

taxing the land or the value of the land '' is a distinction without a difference . you ca n't get blood from a stone . people pay property taxes every year . just because you 're not paying them does n't mean governments are n't successfully collecting them . x200b the problem , as you 've eloquently explained , is that property taxes disincentivize highdensity development that maximizes the rental income capacity and thus the value of the land parcel . x200b lets make this very , very , very simple . i have lived in a house for 50 years . the market value '' has increased but i want to stay in my own home . how do i get fractional value out of the home , when no cash is being generated ? x200b an lvt would realistically result in lower total property tax burden than the status quo . as more housing becomes developed postlvt , the assessed value of suburban detached singlefamily houses decreases due to housing demand being met in the urban core . x200b as to your question about fractional value out of a home , you would n't get such a thing . however , cash '' is being generated by the income of the homeowner . house prices are based on ability to purchase , which is a multiple of the homeowner 's aftertax income . you should 've already known this . x200b x200b the aggression comes from your unearned condescension when parrotting a very , very , very stupid idea . property taxes need to be abolished , not turned into the only source of taxes . x200b there 's no unearned condescension even involved . at this point you 're admitting to being angry about absolutely nothing , at all . it 's peculiar given the harmonious agreement of pretty much our entire conversation . x200b what 's genuinely the matter , bud ?	ekten3f	Economics

redlining refers to the practice of mortgage companies drawing red lines '' on their local maps , creating areas of town where they would actively discourage or outright deny black people 's mortgage applications thus forcing the black people who did qualify for mortgages into certain areas . this practice still occurs today , though it is of course illegal a black applicant for a mortgage has the same chance of being approved as a white one ... unless they apply in person , or otherwise tip their hand in a way that gives away their racial identity for example , a stereotypical black name . the same effect is observed for hiring practices a black man with an identical resume and a clean record actually has a lower chance of callback than a white applicant with a felony . predatory lending disproportionally affects people of color because it disproportionately targets them . payday loan places , check cashing '' debit card '' businesses all permeate lowerincome and majorityminority areas of town . combine the quick availability of predatory credit , with a lack of generational education the younger people of color today may have better access to good credit products , but their parents , and especially grandparents , most certainly did not . also , recall that schools in these areas are generally less well funded , and non essential '' things like personal finance are often first on the chopping block . essentially , american society has , and continues to have , its ' thumb on the scale where people of color as a group are concerned . they were systematically forced to live in certain areas , which were then permeated with predatory businesses , and dropped the school quality as close to zero as possible . this continues in the present day .	ew411fl	Economics

to the point on health insurance , health spending undoubtedly takes a larger portion of the average person 's paycheck today than it did 30 years ago . what categories have decreased to such a point where as to cover for the health insurance ? if health insurance only took 5 of one 's income back in 1980 and now takes 20 for a family . these are only rough estimates , but they 're pretty close . on top of this , the health insurance we receive today is not the same as what one could expect 40 years ago . you 're expected to pay far more out of pocket . so if inflation adjusted total compensation is 70,000 today and you 're paying 14,000 for health insurance , your total take home is 56,000 . back in 1980 you could make as little as 60,000 inflation adjusted and still take home the same amount . i 'm only talking health insurance premiums at this point and not the health spending .	f6pb3wo	Economics

the article frames the student loan crisis as a problem of information , when that is not what it is it is a problem of competing markets . an entire sector of people went to college striving for better wages and jobs , and in doing so , the value of their degrees has been diluted , the jobs they re getting are paying less , and , to top it off , the cost of being competitive in the new , hypereducated marketplace has risen in response to the demand . how does the article propose to fix the fact that retaillevel jobs are asking that one has a bachelors degree ? how does it address the problem of degrees being worth less than they used to and thereby pushing students into jobpath studies while academic pursuits atrophy and fewer people have either the time or interest to examine them ? it s another dishonest article looking for an enemy in the shadow of a crisis . some people were very well aware of the costs of these institutions and made the push anyway because the pursuits mattered to them , and the reality is that life is getting pushed back for those people . it isn t because they didn t have a financial literacy class in 11th grade , it s because the market itself is hyper competitive and tightening by the day . if they want to address the problem , the government needs to set caps for the cost of education , better the programs and rewards for paying back the debt , step in and audit the workplaces demanding bachelors degrees and ask these employers what exactly it is that their workforce needs 4 years of education atop other prior experience , and then help ensure that those with debt don t have to put life off because of it . do they need to abolish the debt ? no . would it be nice ? it would be the biggest economic stimulus since the eu was formed , but it almost certainly will never happen . so instead of toying with the public with empty promises , the government and their officials should put together a plan that actually makes a lick of sense , one where you can have some of that debt forgiven if you do x y or z , the current model btw has a rejection rate of about 99 for loan forgiveness . it would be amazing for the government to forgive student debt , but it won t , so the best thing to hope for is that the government gets off of its ass and start doing anything at all to address the problem , and not just handing out pamphlets to exhausted teens that know very well they re going to need that degree for most nontrade jobs .	et1y1pp	Economics

i know that . i 'm saying you came in around 1213 years ago . rents were reasonable then . if you lived in the same apartment , rent stabilization laws prevented your landlord from jacking up your rent so you get gradual increases . rents have gone up dramatically in the last 2 years for people who are moving in . i was looking for places in lic for the last 2 years . when i looked 34 years ago , the rates were somewhat reasonable , even for 3 bedrooms . these places have gone up dramtically in recent years . i have seen coops in elmhurst shoot up over 50k in the last 2 years as a result of the increases in the lic area since the effects trickle through all of queens .	eh7f1yc	Economics

the fed could use a golden rule abandon the ph.d. standard , which brought the era of government bailouts and too big to fail . by james grant july 11 , 2019 651 pm et though money can t talk , people can t stop talking about it . with the nomination of judy shelton to the federal reserve board , the discussion has tilted to gold . gold is money , or a legacy form of money , ms. shelton contends , and the gold standard is a reputable , even superior , form of monetary organization . the economists can hardly believe their ears . the central bankers roll their eyes . how can this obviously intelligent woman be so ignorant ? let us see about that . america was on one metallic standard or another from the founding until president richard nixon announced the suspension of the treasury s standing offer to foreign governments to exchange dollars for gold , or vice versa , at the unvarying rate of 35 an ounce . the date was aug. 15 , 1971. ever since , the dollar has been undefined in law . its value against other currencies rises or falls , as the market , sometimes with a nudge from this government or that , determines . the dollar isn t unusual in this respect . with few exceptions , the values of the world s currencies oscillate . in the long sweep of monetary history , this is a new system . not until relatively recently did any central bank attempt to promote full employment and what is called price stability but is really a neverending inflation by issuing paper money and manipulating interest rates . the advance of computer technology has made possible a worldwide monetary system based on the scientifically informed discretion of ph.d. economists . the fed alone employs 700 of them . gold standard means not one system but many . you can think of them as a broadway hit , the roadshow version of the hit , and the highschool dramaclub editions . the version nixon scuttled didn t have the starch , elegance , universality or populist inclusion of the classical gold standard . it was drama club . the trueblue standard was sweet and simple . participating nations defined their money as a fixed weight of gold . citizens could exchange currency for gold , or gold for paper , as they chose . gold moved freely across national borders . it went where interest rates and business opportunities beckoned . gold was base money over it rose the superstructure of credit . fixedness was one defining feature of the classical gold standard . trust in the workings of supply and demandin the price mechanism was a second . belief in individual responsibility for financial outcomes was a third . a central bank s single objective was to assure convertibility of the currency it managed at the fixed and statutory price . the exchange rate , not employment , growth or price stability , was the all in all . the bank of england was very desirous not to exercise any power , as a director of that institution testified before a committee of the house of commons in 1832. the bank was content to allow the people to regulate the money supply by exercising their right to exchange bank notes for bullion . a 20thcentury scholar , reviewing the record of the gold standard from 18801914 , was unabashedly admiring of it only a trifling number of countries were forced off the gold standard , once adopted , and devaluations of gold currencies were highly exceptional . yet all this was achieved in spite of a volume of international reserves that , for many of the countries at least , was amazingly small and in spite of a minimum of international cooperation . . . on monetary matters . this remarkable performance , essentially the product of an unusually favorable combination of historical circumstances , appears all the more striking when contrasted with the turbulence of post1914 international financial experience and remains , even today , a source of some measure of fascination and indeed of puzzlement to students of monetary affairs. arthur i. bloomfield wrote those words , and the federal reserve bank of new york published them , in 1959. the gold standard , the fly wheel of the industrial revolution , as the historian lewis e. lehrman puts it , was as imperfect as any other human institution . prices were stable over the long term but variable in the short run sometimeseven for years on endthey fell . sometimes governments interfered with gold movements . there were panics when the bankers overissued their ious . and when people ran on the banks to exchange those claims for goldwhen stock prices crashed and business activity stopped colda central bank would respond by raising its interest rate to defend the exchange rate . it was the exchange rate , one s standing in the international monetary community , that mattered . goldstandard central banking concerned itself with the present . millennial central bankers dare to take a view of the future . the moderns forecast , or attempt to forecast , economic growth , inflation , employment . it s no fault of theirs that they usually miss , most memorably in 2008 , when the biggest event of their professional lives took most of them unawares . the economists are dealing with human beings , not raindrops . the national weather service , which does deal with raindrops , and which marshals enormous computing power and truly big data , has an ordinary forecasting horizon of seven to 10 days . the central bankers inadvisedly cast their predictions into the distant future . the ideology of the gold standard was laissezfaire that of the ph.d. standard let s call it is statism . goldstandard central bankers bought few , if any , government securities . today s central bankers stuff their balance sheets with them . in the goldstandard era , the stockholders of a commercial bank were responsible for the solvency of the institution in which they held a fractional interest . the ph.d. standard brought the age of the government bailout and too big to fail . while goldstandard central bankers set shortterm interest rates , they did not seek to control longerterm rates , much less drive them to zero . in today s monetary regime , some 13 trillion of debt securities worldwide are priced to deliver a yield of less than zero . there s been nothing like it in 4,000 years of recorded interestrate history . and if gold could once be brushed aside as an anachronistic form of money , that time is no more , with private companies competing to bring digital gold to the blockchain . in 1989 , ms. shelton published the coming soviet crash , a brilliant and courageous analysis of the weakness of an overrated collectivist economy . she could be just the woman to remind the fed s doctors of economics how monetary capitalism works . mr. grant is founder and editor of grant s interest rate observer and author of bagehot the life and times of the greatest victorian , out july 23. appeared in the july 12 , 2019 , print edition .	etmzyph	Economics

the 15 piggyback loan is usually a higher interest rate , and while you may be able to avoid mortgage insurance premiums you re still paying more than you would have in the first place for the same money if you could have afforded the down payment . the financing costs are worse in this instance even though the down payment may not be as big of an obstacle . not necessarily the best option for prospective buyers that have issues finding down payment cash in the long run , even if the mortgage interest can be written off .	f05r2vb	Economics

i mean.. you do realise that this is exactly what you are doing ? no , i do n't realize that . i did n't make any arguments or even mention any other economic truths , beyond the fact that it can be frustrating . you talk like the fed is supposedly so magical when that 's not at all how it presents itself and they fully acknowledge any uncertainty . its very existence is dependent on the fact that it has mystical qualities and the people who control it are somehow privy to every aspect of the markets and ramifications of its actions , able to factor in innumerable permutations and consequences of their decisions in ways that the proletariat are not capable . the economy can not manage itself , therefore you need a handful of phd holders to manage it instead . there 's a lot of talk about what they find likely or unlikely and a lot of talk about rather waiting and seeing than acting too soon . that 's kind of the opposite of some kind of we 're omniscient and know better than you '' attitude . it is ? then why ca n't the masses just vote on interest rate changes ? why do we need a board of surrogate decision makers if they do n't know any better than the screaming masses ? and your talk about how supposedly central banks ca n't help during recessions , i mean , what the hell do you think happens ? they just do stuff for shits and giggles ? that 's about the size of it , yep . they want to be seen as doing something '' about the problem '' that needs a solution . '' politicians can claim that they are taking action , and voters who do not understand basic economics will continue to vote for them as a reward for doing something . '' the general consensus is that any time the fed gets involved with recessions , it makes it worse and prolongs it . the paul krugmans of the world i 'm sure would disagree and start espousing the joys of mmt . the fed is an abomination , regardless of what the good folks at brookings and princeton want to say .	eyco54m	Economics
