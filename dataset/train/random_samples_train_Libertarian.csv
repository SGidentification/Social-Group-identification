well more than anything she 's inexperienced which means she has n't really done much to crush people 's personal freedoms . but as for libertarian stances she is staunchly progun . not a big accomplishment but considering the other 3 gungrabbers in the presvp slots , it 's something . cut spending fairly drastically in alaska . wikipedia has a few stories on that if you wan na check it out . used ebay to sell a jet the former governor bought with state money . went after some fellow gop'ers when they tried to use their positions to make money off of oil and gas deals . all pretty minor stuff except the gun thing , but she does n't seem dreadful like mccain , obama and biden .	c0583we	Libertarian

money is more efficiently turned into wealth by , for example , giving hundred poor people a hundred dollars if only it were true , what a great world we would live in ! but let 's look at it in reality wealth of the nation productive capacity is a function of capital accumulation and investment , which is derived from savings , which savings is in turn derived from underconsumption . we can thus say that future increases in wealth are derived from under consumption . following me ? so , the degree to which assets are consumed or alternatively invested , is going to give us our future wealth . people under a certain income will most definitely consume every resource they come in contact with the middle class negative savings rate ! , even if the consumption was not necessary for their survival . thus , giving money to poor people consumes resources , removing them from investment , and lowers overall future wealth . on the other hand , moderately high income and above persons tend to be under consumers of the capital at their disposal , capital which is then saved and invested , which then creates future wealth . it may of course hamper the motivation of some to create wealth redistribution efforts do not necessarily hamper the motivation to create wealth if the redistribution is low enough but what the efforts will ensure in all cases , is to remove the surplus of the rich money they would n't have consumed and give it to the poor which will be consumed and thus will lower overall future wealth . the most important principle to keep in mind is that consumption of resources and capital goods diminishes future earnings , underconsumption and investment increases future earnings .	c061vin	Libertarian

successful and school voucher do n't go in the same sentence . if you ca n't afford private school , your kid wo n't be adding to the scholastic quality of said institution . they will be detracting from it . if you wanted a method to increase racial tension and lower the quality of a private education , then vouchers are definitely the way to go ... but it 's a retarded idea if you want to leave people willing and able to pay for a real education and maintain the quality of education they are paying for . handouts are a bullshit method of watering down private institutions so they are no better than the public daycare for troubled teens that masquerades as public school . hint if you ca n't afford to pay for private school you should not have any fucking kids in the first place much less wait for a handout from the american taxpayer to send them to private school . they call the program a success '' because the kids that were sent benefitted.. but it 's a failure because the kids that were already there suffered as a result and their parents worked to be able to send them there . there 's a certain environment that is conducive to higher learning , and that does n't include kids from unstable homes that ca n't afford the cost of the education in the first place . these parents should be concentrating on making the public schools better or having less or no kids that they ca n't afford to take care of properly .	c04nvqb	Libertarian

right , but it was n't those private industries fault at all , just the liberals while under a gop super majority . cmon , you call yourself a a dr. and then present total bullshit like that . the blames goes all around realtors , appraisers , banks , energy and health industry , endless bush spending , and yes gop and dem lack of action . but the gop has run congress since the clinton administration . they ca n't pass the buck and say this all happened in the last two years . that defies even the 9th grade common sense that the average american has . the real problem is letting the wealthy constantly consolidate everything which undermines the free market and democracy itself . they 've destroyed the integrity of the free press and therefore america 's information source through media consolidation . we need to tax the upper income brackets to remove the incentive of consolidation and give the edge back to small business . this is how we won world war 1 and world war 2 and got out of the great depression . tax the top brackets . and guess what , their wo n't be unnecessary wars for profit as much when you pay for war with taxes on the wealthy . cutting every corner possible to get the lowest wholesale value of disposable foreign goods is a much harder model to sell for small businesses rather than mega corporations like walmart . supply and demand relies on the informed consumer and consolidation destroys that ability of the consumer to shape the market . free market is run by consumer demand , but at some point of market consolidation it becomes more like demand and supply . we buy what is in mass availability for cheap rather than demand what vendors should supply because companies like walmart have taken control of the 'demand ' aspect from the consumers . growing the economy on false economic principles such as monopolies are good was always bound to cause a problem . here we are . the blame sits first on those banks that choose of their free market will to run 30 parts debt to 1 part equity . blaming the dems , who realistically only have a house majority , unless you 're naive enough to call lieberman a democrat , is just childish finger pointing . ph 'd that you misinformed ass nugget . your bullshit could n't even convince a 9th grader . why not just declare ... blame clinton ! !	c05qb5m	Libertarian

other than preventing trade in dangerous materials . government should not interfere with trade for both deontological and consequentialist reasons . witholding free trade from those we do not agree with has the possibility of stoking the flames of their hatred . moreover , terrorist groups will not come forward with shipping addresses for delivery of trade items we are talking about witholding trade from other nation states . this leads to the poor in those countries suffering and those in power feeling almost nothing . trade sanctions rarely work because the people with the guns just starve the weaker out .	c0524vz	Libertarian
about the planes could i demand tolls for planes over my house in this model ? or do property rights become threedimensional , with a ceiling ? if so , then who owns the higher air ? the airline company ? i 'm genuinely curious as to how you envision this working . precedent based law and arbitrage . if you think someone is trespassing on your property you can try to reach an agreement with him or if this does not work call him before a court . as for stratosphere conflicting claims will regulated either by agreement or by , again , courts . by that standard , the swedish health care system is privatized for a citizen of south korea it is . as for ocean , there will be vast areas which nobody will want . no problem at all . but if someone will want exclusive rights to a specific area he will to gain them either by some kind of agreement or if nobody else has an interest in that area . that 's how the early radio stations were picking frequencies before federal regulations . but the social relationship of a purelymarket economy and society has excluded him from the possibility of having basic needs and some notsobasic needs like education met . so , again , if joe brown is not able to work and produce , he has to live at the expense of some other people , who are able to work . that 's a question of charity not economics . maybe even train himself into a job that he can perform and why will not a pure market economy allow joe to train himself into a job ? it would be even easier without minimumwage laws for really poorskilled joes and expensive and lengthy stateimposed education for young and ambitious joes . that through a balanced set of social institutions , we can reduce both rather than just one . as we 've seen in scandinavia , for example , where few are poor , few are rich , and the general standard of living is very high . i do know very little , about scandinavia , so i 'll rather not discuss it . property is a social institution like any other . no it 's not . mine property is mine , not yours . sorry . it has to be said . it has its uses and drawbacks . uses include motivating higher levels of efficiency and providing for stability in the lives of those fortunate enough to have property . drawbacks include inequality and power imbalances . social engineering at it worst . and for most petty reasons that i can think of . since there will be always some kind of inequality your quest against property will never end . well maybe , when there will no property anymore .	c04i8q2	Libertarian

you want to argue against a tiny subset of an idea and use that to tar the whole idea . this is actually what you do when you use two forms of voluntary socialism as examples . this , in fact , is a tiny subset of the economic definition that i used . since i discuss an economic problem , not a tiny , mutualist organization , it makes no sense to bring in the small branch of socialism that you talk about . it is possible to have socialism and capitalism both operate in the same society . i agree . but only voluntary socialism , not a socialist society . of course , i referred to a socialist society , and have only referred to a socialist society , and you completely ignored this . anyway , the whole point is that i explicitly defined the term , at the outset , to avoid confusion . of course , you come in hell bent on creating confusion and bringing in the noneconomic and ideologically driven ways to use the term .	c064ze1	Libertarian

ron paul said since 1973 , abortion in america has become routine and justified by a contorted understanding of the right to privacy . the difference between american rejection of abortion at the beginning of the century compared to today 's casual acceptance is like night and day . although a vocal number of americans express their disgust with abortion on demand , our legislative bodies and the courts claim that the procedure is a constitutionally protected right , disregarding all scientific evidence and legal precedents that recognize the unborn as a legal , living entity , deserving protection of the law . ironically , the greatest proponents of abortion are the same ones who advocate imprisonment for anyone who disturbs the natural habitat of a toad . this loss of respect for human life in the latter half of the 20th century has yet to have its full impact on our society . without a deep concern for life and with the casual disposing of living human fetuses , respect for liberty is greatly diminished . this has allowed a subtle but real justification for those who commit violent acts against fellow human beings . '' and with that , i have lost all respect for him and i say that as someone who donated money to his campaign . he went from talking about what is and is not constitutional , to what does and does not have legal precedent . it 's always the special interest or religious bullshit that turns good politicians to the evil side . in this speech , paul actually tries to associate prochoice with antiliberty . that is what george w. bush does associates what he personally does not like with a threat to liberty . piss on it .	c04omrf	Libertarian

part of the problem stems from arrow 's impossibility theorem . it 's not easily possible for a directvoting system to accurately represent the appropriate rankings of the majority given any system of choice of which ours is a bad one anyways . so necessarily we end up with two candidates to pick from after a mathematically questionable electoral process to begin with even assuming everyone is informed , the electoral process ca n't meaningfully represent the opinions of the electorate . reference URL and i agree that most people do n't understand the point of third parties in that they pick up steam and tell the main two parties hey , you need to incorporate some of these ideas because you 'll lose power if you do n't .

there is no doubt that the dems are vastly more fiscally responsible if you just look at the government spending stats and stop listening to the media for your political education . and once again we see the assertion that any view other than a left oriented one is unworthy of discussion due to our complete lack of understanding of the world and how it functions . at what point did spending stop originating in the house of representatives and move to the white house ? how many of the regan and bush 1 budgets were declared doa by a democratic controlled house ? who was in charge of house appropriations during both of those presidencies ? dan rostenkowski d . where is his current residence ? federal prison . what was the primary reason that clinton was able to balance the budget ? spending cuts ? nope . refinancing the federal debt from 20 yr bonds to short term instruments did this . that is a great trick for short term gain but we can see what happens long term . just because you took an economics course at your local indoctrination center does not grant you understanding of the actual history and what really happened . can you cite one nation in the history of the world that has ever taxed itself into prosperity ? and why would you support a constitutional scholar that holds the second amendment in such utter contempt ? what part of congress shall make no law '' in open to interpretation ?	c06cc5b	Libertarian

that joins some dots for me . the cause of the great depression was seen as a puzzle until milton friedman published his monetary history of the united states which showed that the money supply had contracted by a third , creating a long and deep depression . elsewhere i 've read that that was n't the whole story , there were other policy errors . introducing tariff barriers did damage , but it is estimated at only 35 of gdp . the national recovery administration tried to direct the economy doing damage worth perhaps 10 of gdp . it has never been clear to me why the fall in the quantity of money had such serious consequences . to a first approximation the quantity of money does n't matter . if aliens abduct half our money we can halve prices and wages and carry on as normal . if they give it back , we double prices and wages , no problem . for a second approximation we try to take account of prices being sticky downwards . if the government expands the money supply everyone is happy to get pay rises and raise prices and it takes a while before it sinks in that they are no better off , indeed the pointless changes in prices are causing complications that are making people worse off . if banking problems shrink the money supply and the government does n't counter this , somehow it is not symetrical . workers strike to resist wage cuts . business try to make a windfall profit by not cutting prices even as sales dry up . deflation runs much less smoothly than inflation . well , maybe . the great depression seemed awfully severe when it looks like it could have been cured by government injecting money into the system or by 33 wage and price cuts all round . but now i read that the government outlawed wage cuts and price cuts . the money supply contracted and the ordinary market response was forbidden . in those circumstances it is hard to attribute blame between the national recovery act and the federal reserve . the great depression was great because the nra stopped people working around the mistakes of the federal reserve .	c05pxnj	Libertarian

exactly . the people here calling this unlibertarian do n't seem to have a real grasp of what libertarianism is . these people are employed by the state of alabama , which is a voluntary transaction . there is no coercion occurring here at all . the state of alabama is introducing a policy applicable only to those whose labor it purchases , as a condition for purchasing said labor . if one wishes to not abide by any such condition , they may quit and find a new job at any time . this point was discussed in detail in an lrc post that was on reddit recently , entitled what libertarianism is not URL . if anything , this policy introduces an aspect of personal responsibility to their employee health benefits , that is much more similar to what you would see if health insurance could be purchased by individuals in the free market the tax code and hundreds of billions in price distorting subsidies have effectively tied health insurance to employment and precludes the possibility of anything resembling a free market in health care in america . prior to this , alabama state employees who are more fit and live healthy lifestyles end up subsidizing the poor lifestyle choices of those who are not so fit . the objections in this section strike me as similar to the way people called foul URL when the airlines began charging various fees for certain amenities that were formerly complimentary . '' the reality , though , is that , previously , these complimentary '' offerings were subsidized by all passengers paying higher prices , whether they used the amenities or not . truly , the fees represent a much more free market approach , as passengers are afforded the opportunity to opt out of paying for services they do not want . in the same sense , this employer policy again , not a law , affords those who are less likely to be running up high medical costs , an opportunity to not subsidize the poor choices of others . what could be more libertarian ?	c055h1n	Libertarian

oh , but never mind , you are talking about economic demand . but its clear that those who can not afford the medical serviced still need or want them . this is the point that socialists miss . while demand will always exist generally for health care , you can not fix prices for it without a discoordination of capital . first , health care '' is n't one interchangeable good . it 's a general term to encompass a wide array of goods and services . second , a singlepayer system must ration services or else people will use it whenever they sneeze . you 're equivocating general demand for health care '' with the explosion in demand that will occur for certain services when people think they 're free . '' to use myself as an example , i do n't have insurance and i only go to the doctor when absolutely necessary . further , since i know that it would be prohibitively expensive in regards to health care to smoke , drink all the time , and constantly eat fast food , i tailor economic decisions accordingly . my value preferences would certainly change if provided with free '' health care . also , the government will fix prices when they pay the bills this does n't allow a market clearing price URL to emerge and you 'll inevitably see shortages . third , all the good intentions in the world can not legislate away scarcity . besides air for the most part , any resource , good , or service is necessarily scarce . even a totalitarian state can not change this fact . fourth , you will not get increased competition by socializing medicine . you 'll get a decrease in supply and the perverse incentive to maximize costs . further , people serve those that cut the check when the state cuts the check , it becomes the customer , not the patient . fifth , you make the two fatal mistakes of marxism 1 assuming that scarcity does n't exist previously mentioned and 2 not comprehending the importance of profits . the market is not a zerosum game as taxation is profits are reinvested and used to increase an owner 's capital stock machinery , real estate , and cash to pay labor . this , not government intervention , allows supply to increase . and it 's this quest for profits that further increases supply entrepreneurs enter a field when they believe they can more efficiently and effectively provide a service than those already doing so . thus , increasing profits lead to greater supply , not decreased profits . sixth , you mention prices being too low . i 've never understood this argument low prices are good ! seventh , a singlepayer system subscribes to the soul killing logic that the only duty you owe to your fellow man is a few swipes on a tax form . in the us , doctors regularly treated poor and elderly patients at reduced rates or for free because doctors generally tend to overwhelmingly care about helping people and will make economic sacrifices to do so . then medicare came along ... and lastly , it 's funny that you point out japan . ignoring that their economic situation is n't analogous in any way , shape , or form to the us , they still have a completely screwed up system the best university students end up entering the field of cosmetic surgery because it 's the only part of the health care sector that does n't fix the price of a doctor 's labor under market value . thus , you get the a '' students doing boob jobs while the c '' students do heart surgeries . trust me , i 'm sympathetic to your point of view i 'm no advocate of greed and screwing other people over . however , an education in econ made me realize i was looking for improvement in the wrong direction . i 'd highly recommend ludvig von mises ' work socialism an economic and socialogical analysis not for the weak of heart but quite worthwhile . available , for free , here .

well , your explanation simply failed . most people seem to disagree with you . in any case , you still are required to explain your disagreement if you want to be part of the intellectual discourse . there really is no way around the fact that some people will pay for products or services that other people get to consume as long as you have a high tax system . that is transfer of wealth . as i explained , giving someone a service they would not otherwise have purchased and one that does not leave them with any tangible goods they might trade is not a transfer of wealth . say i buy you a gift card to an upscale spa but the gift card has your name on it , and it is n't valid for anyone but you . you ca n't trade it or sell it , and they wo n't give you a refund for it . you would n't have gone to the spa otherwise because you just do n't think it 's worth the price , or maybe you could n't have afforded it , or whatever . so even if you go to the spa , you are n't saving money you would have otherwise spent . and you have n't received anything you can sell or trade . has your wealth increased ? no , not really . it 's true that you received a service of value no one is denying that . but once it 's over and done , you 're in the same economic position you were in before . but presumably a wealth transfer would have to increase your wealth . that 's why i do n't think we should count this as a transfer of wealth .	c0629af	Libertarian

a child absolutely should n't be punished for the shortcomings of his parents . for that to happen is a tragedy . but i 'm not prepared to say government force is the answer to all sad stories . some parents teach their kids bigotry . some parents abuse their children 's psyches with stories of everlasting torment for the wicked called hell '' . i mean , where is the line drawn here ? should the government manage all the minutia of childrearing , taking away the rights of the parents to do so ? the state can force you to educate your kids , force other people who do n't even have children to pay for it , so why not force parents to make their kids exercise , eat well and watch ageappropriate media ? hell , statistics prove that kids from single parent homes have a harder time succeeding , so why not let the state manage that too ? laws penalizing single parents sound good ? if parents ca n't be trusted to properly educate their child , why are they trusted to feed their child properly ? should there be laws against feeding your kid junkfood ? should healthy nutrition '' be mandatory like schooling '' ? both inarguably have the capacity to greatly affect a child 's life in the future . ever seen a daytime talk show about obese children ? a morbidlyobese 5yearold is a fucking tragedy . even if dr. phil succeeds in convincing this kid 's stupid parents to put him on a diet which is unlikely , it wo n't really matter the pitiful fucker is always going to be fat . how this kid was fed as a 5yearold will determine much about the rest of his life . and he did n't choose it . that 's why this story is so sad he will likely grow up to be lonely , unhappy and unhealthy . he will eventually succumb to some obesityrelated disease after suffering for many years , consuming an inordinant amount of healthcare resources appropriated trying to prolong the life of a metabolicallydefective human . sad story is n't it ? it 's not the kid 's fault . even after reaching adulthood , he 's very unlikely to overcome the fuckedup metabolism his parents gave him . and it all could have been avoided if his parents were n't morons . fucking tragedy . now . let 's tell a hypothetical story about a nation without free compulsory education . a story about a kid whose parents either did n't want to , or could n't afford to send him to school the kid grows up , and being functionally illiterate , has no choice but to work exhausting menial jobs to support himself , retiring early with a bad back to collect social security . another sad story ? absolutely . every child deserves an education . incidentally , that story pretty well describes many public highschool graduates as well , which might say something about government education . regardless , however it happens , it 's a tragedy , absolutely . so which story is sadder ? which child most deserves the 'compulsory ' help of the alwaysbenevolent gub'mint ? timmy ca n't read , but jimmy is drowning in his own fat . after experiencing the serious illnesses of loved ones , i can honestly say for myself and those i love , i value health over education . i 'd rather my kids be stupid than sick . i feel the most pity for 'fat jimmy ' , no question . at least timmy can work nights while he pays for his own schooling . jimmy is probably just screwed . sure , jimmy can diet , but dieting is far less successful in fixing obesity than school is in fixing stupid . should n't the government protect children from future tragedy ? protect them from the failings of their parents ? if it 's reasonable to force parents to send their kids to go to a government school , is it not also reasonable to force them to adhere to a governmentapproved diet for their children ? what laws could be written to achieve this end ? how could a standardized diet be enforced ? what could the penalty be for having a fat kid ? fines ? kidnap the kid and send him to stateapproved foster care ? or maybe send the kid to a special staterun fat school '' where his foodintake can be closely monitored by stateappointed teachers for deviations from what is defined as a healthy diet by government bureaucrats ? does this sound like a noble undertaking ? does it make you feel philanthropic to imagine parents being told by the government how to feed their own children ? not me . i find the idea disgusting . but how is any of this orwellian nightmare of diet police '' fundamentally different from compulsory education ? parents face fines , imprisonment or even losing custody of their kids if they do n't send them to a stateapproved school . if jimmy 's parents want to forcefeed him ice cream , it 's really not my responsibility . how someone else raises their own children is no more my business than how i raise mine should be to others . in fact , the only way i can truly help jimmy out is by breaking natural law . i could abduct him , or perhaps threaten or blackmail his parents to force my ideas on them . that would , of course , be wrong . but i can elect a politician who will write laws and pay government employees to do it for me , which is apparently okay . the state can trample the civil and natural rights of parents while i get to feel good about myself , because presumably , my government is saving children from a life of obesity or ignorance by the barrel of a gun held by a stateemployee . if timmy ca n't read , it 's not my fault . if jimmy is obese , i 'm really supersorry about that , but it 's not my fault . if johnny 's parents do n't discipline him properly so he grows up to be a criminal , or if they teach him to be a nazi or a mormon , it 's not my fault . it 's not the government 's and therefore my responsibility to fix everything . if i could somehow avoid paying property taxes on my house , and therefore avoid doing my patriotic duty to fund the state education system it still would n't feel the least bit responsible that timmy ca n't read . his parents , his teachers are responsible . timmy is n't responsible . he 's just a kid . too bad for him , really . how dare anyone advocate stealing my money to fund a sorry state school system that ca n't even guarantee literacy in 13 years of mandatory schooling ! i 'd rather pay for the fat kid 's junkfood .	c067jpg	Libertarian

money is just a medium of exchange . it helps facilitate transaction . barter systems only work with small types of transactions . barter can not scale to grow an economy . the ability to forcast and calculate costs is impossible without a standard medium of exchange . most libertarians support private property as a fundamental to freedom because of the selfownership axiom . you can deny private property and support selfownership , but you 're just living a contradiction as you 're granting private property in one instance but denying it in others . i 'm not saying this is your argument , just that this is the common reasoning behind the private property is essential for freedom view . i 'd like to hear more of your ownership less freedom argument .	c06iir2	Libertarian

well i 'd disagree on a few key points we do n't need to give up our liberties to these organisations so they can protect us from climate change we absolutely have to get up our economic liberties for this to occur . i have n't seen any government budget 's coming in with line items that say free '' on them . aside from the topic a little , do you think the government using your tax dollars for environmental projects is worthwhile ? i tend to not see the argument in these terms . the fruits of my labor are to be enjoyed by me and spent how i deem fit not by some bureaucratic entity . the government gets money for its programs by using the implied threat of force . this is just like how the mafia operates except on a much larger scale and everyone pretends its ok. whether or not the program is worthwhile '' is immaterial . if i were to break into your house , steal your life savings that maybe was to go to your children 's continued education and use it on a worthwhile '' cause would you not still be angered by it ? if i used that money to say , build a ramp for handicapped people , you 'd physically see the ramp and people may hold me up as some sort of hero and champion for the handicapped . what is unseen , however , is that your children would be lacking the education you worked for to provide them and the world would lose out on having more intelligent , thoughtful members of society . the problem with assuming government programs are good '' is that the unseen is unaccounted for . maybe the dollars taken to fund the iraq war would have been used by a private citizen or a company to advance a breakthrough in clean energy technology or to cure a disease or to help those in need . we 'll never know because government thieved the money and used it on something that was deemed worthwhile at the time .	c04bn0e	Libertarian

to me , capitalism has always seemed morally wrong . by definition , capitalism is driven by the motivation of selfish gain . people are encouraged to compete against one another . the name of the game is profit . wealth is merely a game of relativity . rather than working against one another , it seems obvious to me that everyone should strive to work towards common goals . we all have essentially the same needs , goals and desires in life . we all seek happiness . we want to learn about our reality , become educated and understand the world around us . we want more than just our basic needs fulfilled . beyond simple survival , what is the point of life ? once we have reached a point in society where each person can expect to have their fundamental needs met with very little effort , where do we go from there ? capitalism is basically merely a game , it 's no different than any sport , football , baseball , etc . there are rules , teams , competitions , in the end there is usually some winner , or a champion , but also all of the players live very well , the only thing which determines their happiness at that stage is whether they win or lose . well , surprise , surprise , i have never been a fan of sports ! i look down upon it , adults getting paid millions of dollars to play games , how ridiculous . i do n't care who wins the superbowl , i really do n't . a lot of intellectuals do n't care either . so what is it about our dislike of sports and capitalism ? it 's because they are one and the same . underlying both is competition . it 's competition for the sake of puffing up the ego . to win . to say , i am better , stronger , faster , more highly trained , or just luckier than you are ! '' . combine with that , the pack mentality , teams working together against other teams . it 's disgusting , small minded and barbaric to me and many other intellectuals i know who feel the same way . the same goes for capitalism . it is simply , intuitively wrong to have a society and an economy based upon people competiting against one another . it 's madness . everybody should be working together towards common goals and that is all !	c06jzx4	Libertarian

oh i found this as well by senator russ feingold URL first , the fisa amendments act would authorize the government to collect all communications between the u.s. and the rest of the world . that could mean millions upon millions of communications between innocent americans and their friends , families , or business associates overseas could legally be collected . parents calling their kids studying abroad , emails to friends serving in iraq all of these communications could be collected , with absolutely no suspicion of any wrongdoing , under this legislation . second , like the earlier senate version , this bill fails to effectively prohibit the practice of reverse targeting namely , wiretapping a person overseas when what the government is really interested in is listening to an american here at home with whom the foreigner is communicating . the bill does have a provision that purports to address this issue . it prohibits intentionally targeting a person outside the u.s. without an individualized court order if , quote , the purpose is to target someone reasonably believed to be in the u.s. at best , this prevents the government from targeting a person overseas as a complete pretext for getting information on someone in the u.s. but this language would permit intentional and possibly unconstitutional warrantless surveillance of an american so long as the government has any interest , no matter how small , in the person overseas with whom the american is communicating . the bill does not include language that had the support of the house and the vast majority of the senate s democratic caucus , to require the government to obtain a court order whenever a significant purpose of the surveillance is to acquire the communications of an american in the u.s. the administration s refusal to accept that reasonable restriction on its power is telling . third , the bill before us imposes no meaningful consequences if the government initiates surveillance using procedures that have not been approved by the fisa court , and the fisa court later finds that those procedures were unlawful . say , for example , the fisa court determines that the procedures were not even reasonably designed to wiretap foreigners outside the u.s. , rather than americans here at home . under the bill , all that illegally obtained information on americans can be retained and used . once again , there are no consequences for illegal behavior . and why should we believe him on the matter you may ask ? here what he has to say regarding that matter from the same link above mr . president , i sit on the intelligence and judiciary committees , and i am one of the few members of this body who has been fully briefed on the warrantless wiretapping program . and , based on what i know , i can promise that if more information is declassified about the program in the future , as is likely to happen either due to the inspector general report , the election of a new president , or simply the passage of time , members of this body will regret that we passed this legislation . i am also familiar with the collection activities that have been conducted under the protect america act and will continue under this bill . i invite any of my colleagues who wish to know more about those activities to come speak to me in a classified setting . publicly , all i can say is that i have serious concerns about how those activities may have impacted the civil liberties of americans . if we grant these new powers to the government and the effects become known to the american people , we will realize what a mistake it was , of that i am sure .	c05bvur	Libertarian

the bailout is just a fraction of bush 's debt spending . there is little reason to think another 12 trillion is going to be the tipping point . we are n't even up to our gnp in debt , so theoretically we are fine , like a homeowner who owes more than a years worth of salary on their mortgage . it 's not the 1.2 trillion dollar bailout either . it 's the 9.6 trillion in debt , the drag of 260 billion in interest per year and the fact americans pay twice as much per person for 37th ranked health care . if we had competitive health care with the rest of the industrialized world , we 'd be paying 1 trillion dollars less per year in health care . that leaves us with more than enough to balance the budget and start paying off the bailout and other debts . we should be targeting the most overpriced industries first to free up money that 's trapped in non competitive corporate profit margins . the rest of the industrialized world can do math just as well if not better and they all switch to national health care , not for the sake of humanity , but to save shit loads of money . as it stands the us health care is by far the most expensive in the world , twice as much as almost anywhere else , and our life expectancy is actually lower . it 's just a matter of efficiency , we need much more private sector efficiency , especially from highly necessary industries like health and energy , which rarely have healthy free market competition . without competition there is no natural regulatory force and therefore the government must step in . what more proof than paying twice as much per person do you need that our health care is broken ? its going up at 10 a year . so in ten years the nation will be paying 4.4 trillion per year for health care . it 's simply not sustainable to pay that much , that way more of a rip off that crude oil prices or exxon 's profit margins .	c05j1tp	Libertarian

this ideology , in turn , is based on the unfounded assumption that everything that is to be funded with my taxes is a better , more necessary investment in society as a whole , than what i would have done with it . in a democracy , taxation gives the voting public an opportunity to shape society . without taxation , society would develop more or less according to the whims of those with great wealth , since only they could afford largescale projects . you may think that eliminating taxes would result in a more fair society , but i say that 's an unproven assumption . what you 're doing by providing intellectual cover for the elimination of taxation , is taking the mainspring out of the state . what people who favor socialized government programs often fail to recognize , is that to remove capital from the market to invest in government bureaucracy , along with the associated price distortions of doing so , often decimates the ability for the market to provide better solutions to the same problems , that are more affordable , efficient , and virtually universally excessable . to tax people in order to open the door to this or that government solution , more often than not , closes the door on a superior free market solution . why then does history show us that improvement in social conditions comes after the application of people power in one form or another , rather than a lightening of tax burdens ? please show me a historical example of a largescale social program implemented without taxes . i 'm sorry , but my one vote in threehundred million is not the kind of odds that , to me , would justify my implied '' consent to all government policies . that is why a republican system is far superior to a democracy . that 's a self limiting perspective . your power to vote one in 300 million is only the beginning of your possibilities for political engagement , not the end . donate , organize , knock on doors , write editorials , run for office , join a party .	c04h1iu	Libertarian

what is the process by which people will become feudal serfs by unregulated capitalism ? increasing disparities and inequalities in wealth . rothbard also labeled and categorized his ideas on libertarianism , why did you have to go out of your way to mention that he did it for his own ends '' ? because he was hijacking a term to promote his own ideas . why else ? if that is what everyone does , why mention it ? did n't the original libertarians call themselves libertarians for their own ends '' as well ? no , they were just labelling and categorising their ideas . as i said that 's what humans do . you said i have not yet made up my mind '' on your ideal society . if you have n't made up your mind at all , how can you be so sure about what you do n't want ? because i broadly know what sort of society i want to live in and what sort of society i do n't want to live in . just as i know i do n't want to live in a sewer but outside it many choices available there . if you are sure about what you do n't want , then right away implies what you do want . for example , if you say you do n't want violence , then that means you do want peace . right , and there are many different ways to live peacefully . but you said that you want to maximize the freedom of the individual . does n't it stand to reason then that if you were concerned about maximizing the freedom of the individual , then would n't you strive to not force individuals to do something they do n't want to do ? right . but communities have laws which are collectively decided an expression of freedom of the majority on how they wish to live . if an individual does n't want to abide by certain laws they should be free to opt out of the community and leave . and you have moved this discussion to democracy itself rather than social democracy . you probably do n't know what social democracy is , so i suggest you look it up . does n't it make more sense to leave the minority alone so that they have maximized freedom , and that they should n't have to leave if they disagree with the majority.. if they do n't want to be a part of a society as governed by the wishes of the majority they are free to leave . membership in a community is a choice . but let 's say on something as innocent as where to build schools , who to hire , what price , etc ? maybe its a big deal to the majority , have you thought that ? if you were really concerned with maximizing freedom of the individual , then leaving the minority alone is a step towards maximal individual freedom is it not ? but you 're forgetting about the freedom of the majority ? they want their society to be run in a particular way . if the minority vehemently disagree with it they should opt out and move . anyway this discussion has little bearing on socialism or social democracy . do you intend to come back on topic some time soon ? because i am quickly losing interest . edited .	c0e8lh5	Libertarian

i do n't for certain , but the likelihood of it being so is greater under a government scheme than a private one purely because of the government monopoly on force . why ? again , as a guy hailing a cab on the street , how do i know any of this ? how do i know the brakes sorry for the earlier typo do n't work or the driver is incompetent ? how do you know otherwise now ? i 'd put more faith in calling the company that i 'd called for reliable cab service for the last n years instead of just picking up any old cab off the street if it was really that big of a deal , which it is n't . i do n't like living in constant fear , so i do n't . anyway , as far as poor people in cabs go , i have long , boring story for you . i spent some time in a caribbean nation that has a much larger majority of poor people that are much poorer than most of those that are considered below the poverty level here . rather than do the tourist resort and casino thing that most expats did , i decided i wanted to live as they did '' as much as was within reason . i had a decent job but it was prohibitively expensive to bring my car due to ridiculous import tariffs and shipping costs , so i made do on carros publicos '' public cars , basically people who would drive their own cars on a somewhat informal ruta '' and my own two feet instead . which , incidentally , was quite fun and exciting aside from lots of boring and unrealistic safety issues no one at that age should be giving a shit about ... anyway , these carros publicos were , for the most part , compact japanese imports since those were the only thing that would withstand the constant abuse given to them on a daily basis . the normal load for , say , a 1983 toyota corolla was 7 people 3 in the front and 4 in the back . everyone , whether they were employed in an office or in construction , would squish in these things and as soon as 1 or more would get off at their destination , they 'd be replaced immediately by more people needing to get on down the road faster than two feet or a rickety bicycle could . buses , or guaguas '' were generally reserved for longer distances , usually people coming in from the outskirts of the city or out in the countryside . at first , the contrast in personal space was a bit unnerving , but after a couple of rides it became fun due to the novelty of the experience as well as the opportunity to practice conversational and colloquial spanish . these people were always proud and easy to engage in interesting conversation with , both amongst themselves as well as with curious foreigners . occasionally there would be a car of american make there , but since they would fall apart a lot faster , they did n't last long there , as well as the daunting difference in fuel efficiency . since they are so big , they 'd cram an extra 8th person in . the fare was quite reasonable maybe 5 cents in the year 2000 and there was no need to have a cashbox or other such secure type of thing since the only people who engaged in that sort of criminal activity were overwhelmingly recent emigres to the usa that had returned with all the corrupted ways they learned there . in fact , there were so many times when i could have just made off with a bunch of pesos sitting in the midcar console , but why when i got so much out of the experience for so little to begin with ? not that i would ever do that , but i found this sort of ... selfregulation if you will of interest . there were a couple of times where i was a bit leery i got in the backseat of one and you could see the road through a couple of rusted cracks in the carpetless floorboard , but after a bit of investigation i figured i just would n't stomp on it , and i certainly could n't stand up in the car ... overall , the system worked fine without the intervention of some magic monopoly on force through benevolent faith in our holy betterthanus masters who have decided they will make an entire career out of doing things that individual human beings are quite capable of managing themselves . granted , the system was n't perfect , but ... i guarantee you i 'm more worried about getting robbed in a cab in a state with stupid gun laws by some psycho certified hacker '' than i am about ... about what , co emissions ? are you fucking kidding me ! ? lol then again , i would n't live in most american cities where i would need a cab , anyway . in summary , i do n't think i 'll be able to convince you that your special government is n't any better at regulating a market than private citizens would , sorry . edited a bit	c070ryc	Libertarian

i 've written a book on the subject of adverse possession URL , so i feel i have to weigh in here . if there was a single person responsible for this cave '' , he was in the wrong , not the state and the police . the property most likely belonged to the state who admittedly were not utilising it all that well . but you see , that 's what adverse possession is all about , and i 'm not saying that just to sell my book like my client who was ghostwriting for is . its a hush hush issue yet it happens because ultimately adverse possession is about keeping the soil tilled and the state knows that , which is why the law is still in affect . the person responsible for that cave , if he was intending to eventually claim adverse possession should have known better and acted more responsibly so that the requirements for the legal process would not be interrupted as they were now so suddenly . he would not have druggies come by , with drugs , and leaving needles strewn around . he would not be pissing and shitting anywhere but in some pipe that leads outside . i have seen allot of adverse possession cases go horribly wrong all over the world , its heart breaking sometimes , but many times its just justice being served . on a parting note , there are 1000s of other cases of adverse possession going on in ca , and even if the presiding judge is n't favourable in some 12 years or whatever the statute of limitations is there , there will be the free rent , and the privilege of being treated like a human when evicted , if you act responsibly . ignorance of the law will not be rewarded .	c09xm1b	Libertarian

no problem , i have to be honest in that i am not quite so extreme myself . there are obviously cases where regulation make sense . i feel that every effort should be made to ensure any such sensible regulation is as minimal as possible . laws are like computer code . there are many ways to skin a cat flip a pancakesolve a problem , but bad code is still bad code , even if it provides correct results most of the time . bad code always leads to unintended consequences . good code in this case law has a clear goal , is minimal , involves no more variables than are required , references those variables as little as possible , and has no memory leaks . i wo n't convince you of libertarianism with this analogy , but perhaps you can see truth and freedom lie somewhere in the middle of both libertarianism and other forms of government .	c070at5	Libertarian

because this tax is so much less of an affront to freedom than , say , the private corporation hired by the govt . when you hear that a government has hanged someone , do you say look ! the rope ! they bought it from home depot the devil ! '' when you see a hangman hang someone , do you worry more over the signature on his pay check than the hanging being done before you ? private firms are completely unaccountable as compared to a govt agency all private firms are accountable to their consumers . they are so much more accountable to them than your government is to you , it 's more appropriate to speak of democracy as a kind of halfbaked attempt to recreate in politics the role you have as a consumer . when someone does something unlawful , inside or titutarly outside the government , it is the state that shields them and declares their acts legally unassailable . i say 'titularly outside ' because a firm whose every 'earned ' dollar comes out of taxation is a creature apart .	a59d	Libertarian

the second amendment of the bill of rights is not horribly written , though i daresay the standards of education regarding american history as well as knowledge of the english language have become rather slipshod . just to be clear all men save certain government agents between the ages of 18 and 45 are in the militia . well regulated '' refers to the responsibility of militia members to provide at their own expense equipment and weaponry in common military usage , privately obtained , owned and maintained in working order should they be called upon to defend their country . considering all 9 other 'natural rights ' enumerated within the bill of rights are individual rights , it is therefore an exercise of some audacity to believe that keeping and bearing arms is some sort of imagined 'group privilege ' not referring to the common practice of the time for every man to be armed . indeed as patrick henry stated guard with jealous attention the public liberty . suspect everyone who approaches that jewel . unfortunately , nothing will preserve it but downright force . whenever you give up that force , you are ruined ... the great object is that every man be armed . everyone who is able might have a gun . '' or as samuel adams says directly the constitution shall never be construed to authorize congress to prevent the people of the united states , who are peaceable citizens , from keeping their own arms . '' it is a poorly read and uneducated man who would be persuaded to relinquish their personal arms on the objections of those who would rule them by force or deceit or also by those who , illimagined , would try to project their own inadequacies to the task of being so armed onto others who have no such limitations . let it not be unuttered that there are many illsuited to be armed , but that does not dispense with the responsibility of those of us who may be safely entrusted to be armed to be so . the very nature of our republic does so depend on these rights and this individual right to be armed most in particular .	c0756xx	Libertarian
seems you missed the point . the original can be summed up as 'liberals think freemarketeers should n't complain about socialism because of all of the socialist goods and services they enjoy ' . the response above handily displays the logical fallacy by reversing roles , i.e . 'conservatives think socialists should n't complain because of all of the goods and services provided by the free market they enjoy ' . while they are ironic situations , it is a logical fallacy to conclude that existing conditions necessarily determine the validity of one 's argument . even if heshe was living under pure socialist or free market conditions , it would neither validate nor falsify hisher arguments for or against each economic system . simply enjoying , or just participating in , a particular economic system does not make you a proponent nor an opponent thereof .	c0fusn4	Libertarian

need i remind you of the declaration of independence ? i 'm glad you brought that up ! while not nearly as legally relevant to lincoln as his sworn oath to uphold the constitution , it was , is and should continue to be , the guiding philosophical and moral statement of our country . '' when in the course of human events , it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another , and to assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature 's god entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation . '' the southern states could never really proclaim their case to the whole world because the europeans despised them for continuing the evil institution of slavery . by 1861 , most of the rest of the world had long abolished it . '' we hold these truths to be selfevident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . '' the southern states every single one of them were actively enslaving human beings . '' that to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , the southern state governments surely did not have the consent of the slaves . '' that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness . '' lincoln sought to alter and abolish '' the oppressive southern system and the south gave him the legal right to do it . '' prudence , indeed , will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn , that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed . '' somehow , the south forgot about this when they started the war by attacking fort sumter ! '' but when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such government , and to provide new guards for their future security . '' lincoln was helping to overthrow the southern aristocracy by the only legal means at his disposal which actively sought to enslave human beings . by definition civil wars are wars where two sides are fighting for control of the same land and government . the south legally and peacefully seceded '' legally '' arguable '' peacefully '' nonsense .	c0ba8j1	Libertarian

excellent response . a few points first , i 'd recommend reading thomas woods ' forthcoming article about warren g. harding . it should have a long discussion of the post wwi labor market . in short , when the soldiers came home , harding did nothing which in turn crashed the labor market . six months of hell ensued but the private economy sure enough absorbed the workers and unemployment fell drastically , wages started to rise again , and a term of peaceful prosperity was set in motion . second , demand for the finished product of the work . i think you 're ignoring say 's law desirable supply inherently creates demand as opposed to demand creating supply . if cheap labor stimulates the demand for said labor , employers will purchase it and bid the price up . in turn , they 'll have the ability to supply more consumer goods which will drop prices until consumers begin to bid prices up . put briefly , i think you 're looking at the productive process backwards instead of forwards by assuming that demand stimulates supply . the owner is able to take profit while the unskilled workers continue to undercut each other on wage so they can buy their next meal . you 're assuming that this goes on forever and has no bottom . see my harding example above .	c0be3p6	Libertarian
what if the boss knows you can not afford to loose a job , and now knows he can command you to do what he wants , would you call that coercion ? he ca n't command you . the worker can choose not to obey and thus lose his job . if i am in such a position that i can not afford to lose the job , that does not change the fact that i have a choice . nobody has a right '' to a job . i know you did n't claim this , but you are surely alluding to it . coercion is making me do something against my will . if i need to keep a certain job , then that is the person 's decision . thus , it is also the person 's decision to listen to the boss . the key here is that its a systematic problem , not just individual . i am not saying every employee employer relationship has coercion . i am saying systematically they do . this confuses me . except for maybe the top 1 of the income bracket , what people do n't need a job ? is n't this your only qualifier to indicate coercion is taking place ? just like taxes systematically are force but they might not be individually , because there are plenty of people who have no problem paying taxes and do not see it as force . there is nothing wrong with voluntary taxes . but none of them are voluntary . if you do n't pay them , your freedom is taken away from you . if you lose your job , you still have your freedom i.e. , freedom to search for another job or source of income . there is no consent when it comes to taxes they just take . this is not the case with a job . i must reemphasize the point of consent when it comes to jobs . all jobs are this way . your taxes analogy would work if , from birth , everyone was assigned to a certain job , and if they did n't work that job , they would be thrown in jail . surely , some people would gladly approve of their appointment , and consent to it but that does n't change the fact that such an appointment is force . from birth , a child does n't have the ability to give consent , and thus , such an appointment is force , even if later in life , they decide that they approve of such an appointment . more importantly , they do n't have the ability to optout of such an appointment if they decide that they no longer consent to it . that begs the question that there must be a boss and that property rights are natural . so of course what you mention would be coercion on the part of the worker ... there is no other outcome in that framework . are you denying property rights then ? if so , that is a fundamental difference in our viewpoints , and probably should have been mentioned before we started talking about the nonaggression axiom . if you deny individual property rights , then this discussion of the nonaggression axiom would seem irrelevant . i thought i used the framework you presented the worker and the boss . what framework would you have me use if mine is the wrong one ? do n't let college narrow your point of view . dissent has never been part of education . well i would say that dissent has never been part of school . mark twain once said , do n't let school get in the way of your education .

no one can force me to do anything , they can only react to my actions . those reactions do not negate my right to act , they are merely responses which may guide my choices . of course they have the ability to force you . as i have mentioned many times , you are arguing that they should not because you believe you have some sort of objective rights that should be respected . there is no rational reason to believe that . society exists in your imagination ... and a study of ethics , by your logic , is a study in something just as abstract as rights . but it is epistemically objective ethics is the study of morality . your concept of rights are n't even that . yes , a group of individuals which are unquestioned in their authority by a majority of people can coerce any action , but that action or a lack of action does not define a right . what defines a right then ? is n't this what this discussion really comes down to ? if there 's no objective reason that they should not take my property , there is no objective reason where they should be able to take my property . but what if they do have the ability ? it would simply a fact that they do . you 're expecting them to respect some fictional concept of rights which they are under no obligation to . my objective basis for property ownership is possession of an item of value which was obtained without objection or violence . that is a nonsequitur . just because you obtained something without objection or violence , it does n't follow that it is yours . only in a society of likeminded folk who act as if the concept of propertyownership is something real and make laws penalising those who do n't behave similarly can it have any sort of existence . and a note to everyone who is downmodding ocin , please stop ... why would you silence someone who is having a respectful discussion ? thanks .	c0bsb1m	Libertarian

ok , so you believe all taxes are wrong , not just some taxes . i think you do too , if you were to be honest with yourself about it . next question is your argument strictly a moral argument , or is there a legal component as well ? for example , do you think the constitution or the law exempts you from taxes e.g . 5th amendment seizure clause , 14th amendment definition of soverign born citizen . moral , but i think there are some good legal arguments against income taxes . for example , i do n't see how an income tax can possibly be consistent with the 13th amendment . if the government takes 3 months of the fruit of my labor every year , then i am an involuntary servant to the state for those 3 months . obviously there ca n't be a good legal argument against taxation in general . do you support the constitution in a libertarian sense ... no . i do , however , occasionally argue the constitutionality of federal programslaws because some people care about such things . the only thing good about the constitution is its ability to limit government power , even if it does a poor job of it .	c0ne3ka	Libertarian

i never made that particular assertion . your assertion no model can model all of reality . i just described the model that would do that . you have to deny that that model could theoretically exist in order to jive with your assertion . it 's not human whims you asshat . yes it is . the moment i expose a flaw in your model , you say , well i was n't intending it to be used for that '' . thankfully , science does n't work that way , and if a scientist proposes a bad model and is called out on it they revise the model to be more accurate with reality . oh , that 's right , equivocating the term whim '' in order to prove a point against an argument i never made . we 'll make an integer lattice grid ! '' here 's why that model fails . '' i was n't intending to model that kind of movement . '' but you just said that defining a limit is whimsical '' . where ? i have never used the term limit . i said trying to attach intention to a model is ridiculous and whimsical . i did not say that defining where a model applies in terms of space and circumstance , which is merely establishing what it is , is whimsical . intention is divorced from definition . that fact that models are a creation of the human mind . so is reality ? lol . a book on your shelf does not mean you read it , you fucker . oh . so we go from a book i never read to a book i own but have n't read . go ahead , try to establish your claim . i dare you . before you go for another copout , just admit that it was a baseless claim and you have no way of proving that i have n't read it , while i can prove in every way that matters that i have . you 're namecalling , and not only namecalling which we 're both doing but about completely irrelevant shit in order to avoid answering the statement that finite infinity , but finite ! infinity , and russel explicitly laid out the quality that makes them unequal . no , it is n't . i can be 100 accurate as to the speed of a car if i measure distance travelled , and start and end time . and i can show you that all you have defined is a single point in time where the car was travelling that speed , and that very likely it was going above for some portion of the trip and below for another . irrelevant . no it 's not . it 's the only rational escape from solipsism . the fact that i can not be cognizant of a pink unicorn orbiting the earth is due to the fact that this does not exist . but you can not be cognizant of a 3d gravitational field . does that mean that it does not exist ?	c0qp5me	Libertarian

first off , calling your opponent a liar is not a good way to start a debate . secondly his argument is a strawman . consider that most hospitals report that upwards of 65 of their patients see them for nonemergency treatment and his payanypriceit'samatteroflifeordeath strawman is describing the minority of situations . in the majority of cases , most people would be able to price shop . out of the 35 remaining emergency cases , i 'm sure a good percentage of those are expected developments that could be planned for ahead of time . if you 're significantly overweight , for example , it might behoove you to get in touch with reality and realize that your risk of a heart attack is elevated , so ifwhen the actual heart attack arrives you 'll already have a hospital chosen . how much of the rest is a completely unexpected emergency , i do n't know . car accidents , lightning strikes , etc but that 's what insurance is for . unfortunately insurance is being used as if it 's a hospital subscription , and i do n't think this will do anything to keep costs under control .	c0pg9f6	Libertarian

your system has already been tried and it has already failed . it never failed . it was just gradually taken over by ignorant intellectuals . the us economy was largely unregulated until the 20th century . and the us economy was largely undergoing the most rapid increase in prosperity ever achieved on earth until the 20th century . naturally occurring monopolies and oligopolies were the norm . monopolies and oligopolies were constantly being broken up soon after they were formed because the market was more competitive . it was n't until the ignorant intellectuals i mentioned above brought socialist philosophy from europe did the public more and more accept government intervention in the economy . once the public became supportive of government intervention , that 's when all the businessmen who wanted oligopolies before and failed pounced on the opportunity and utilized the newly introduced state power for their own benefit . but it was the intellectuals that let loose the government beast . all action starts with ideas . with most states having their own currencies sometimes even individual banks within states , there was a huge counterfeit and fraud problem . no , there was n't . that is a total exaggeration . money and credit were more stable under the gold standard . but it was n't perfect because there were loopholes in the system that allowed states and banks with state support to issue their own paper currencies , and that is where the problems arose . sure , meat companies were selling good cuts , but there was no incentive to not sell ground up bones and entrails to people as well , which they did . of course there was an incentive . the incentive is profit and economic competition . in economic competition , the more competitive the market , the more incentive there is in producing high quality products . the less competition there is , the less incentive there is . big strong government and guns and violence and threats will never substitute for free market competition . who are the special interests you speak of ? the very same people and companies who would be in direct control if there were n't these agencies . the special interests are only utilizing the power that was yearned for and gotten by the statist intellectuals . it was the statist intellectuals that always yammered for more government control over people 's economic lives . well , that wish came true and that is why these special interest groups have so much influence . if the government power was n't there , then there would be nobody to influence and bribe . just because the state intervention did n't go the way they expected , it does n't mean it 's other people 's fault . it 's the fault of the people who held the dogma that there can be such a thing as positive state intervention ! i agree though that the ratings agencies are silly and a huge part of the recent crisis along with congress ' support of the fannie and freddie operations . that 's good that you understand this very important point . it creates moral hazard .	c0mcajr	Libertarian
first , the earth resources are immense , and we are only putting to use a small fraction of them . goods putting resources to use towards an end on the other hand , are limited by our ability to produce them . the rich countries , by producing more goods than poor countries , do not prevent them from getting richer africa , for example , is one of the richest continent in natural resources , but where production of goods is at its lowest . mass poverty in the world today is entirely due to lack of respect for private property . second , ownership of property , if not private , but be owned by someone as long as it is controlled . so if you do n't support private ownership , you leave ownership to the state , i.e . the proper definition of socialism . finally , to understand why socialism leads to poverty , you must study economics , especially the economic calculation argument see mises . as a note , you can refer to this map URL to see the reason why countries are poor a direct correlation to economic freedom .	c0zf9ai	Libertarian

huge costs are still huge , even if government steps away . you 're still not seeing the forest for the trees . in just about every single industry known to man , prices for goods and services decrease over time as production becomes more efficient . yet in health care , prices continually rise . why is that ? it 's precisely because government funds inefficiency through subsidization and regulation . if we really wanted to save money we should eliminate the profiting off of health insurance , freeing up tons of nurses hours spent with insurance companies , and all those profits that were being made by insurance companies would go into the health care system . how is it that profit creates efficiency in every other sector of the economy , except for health care ? why is profit in health care such a bugaboo ? why is n't profit in food maligned even moreso than in health care , when food is even more necessary for the survival of people than health care ? and all those profits '' constitute maybe 23 of revenue , which is pretty low compared to other industries .	c11ft2r	Libertarian

after googling 2010 patriot act vote '' , this URL came up second . enjoy ! edit it appears that gaso beat me by a minute , but my link explains how this passed with an unrelated name . go to the web site of the clerk of the house , and you ll see no vote from today about the patriot act at all . what you will see is roll call 67 , on motion to concur in senate amendments for h.r . 3961 , the medicare physician payment reform act . that s the vote on whether to extend the patriot act without any reforms of its abusive spying programs . it doesn t look like it , of course , but the patriot act extension is what s referred to by senate amendments . the senate democrats sneaked the patriot act extension into a medicare reform bill , and then voted by voice vote to approve the amendment so that no politician would have to have their name attached to this shameless abandonment of liberty . the house democrats benefited from the maneuver as well , being able to vote on unnamed amendments related to medicare reform , rather than having it on the record for everyone to see that they voted to renew the worst abuses of the patriot act without any effort to protect americans from their spying powers at all .	c0l94w0	Libertarian

statism is just an economic and social idea . any idea can be pursued with religious fervor , including libertarianism . i 'm just saying that , in the absence of religion , most of them become much more attached to their political ideologies to the point of dogma . perhaps i 'm more attached to my political ideology because i 'm not religious . i came to libertarianism the same way i came to atheism . i found that it 's pragmatic . if people want freedom for themselves , they must be willing to accept what other people do with that freedom even if they do n't personally like it . otherwise there 's an ensuing arms race '' of sorts where people rush to apply as many laws against people they dislike as they can , which results in everyone being unfree . it 's also why i reject keynesian economics which both political parties now support . the theory does not succeed in its aims , and that becomes clear when you put it under any scrutiny at all . if we 're to be rational and pragmatic about things , we have to be willing to admit when ideas do n't work . we ca n't just ignore the consequences of social experimentation and blindly adhere to an ideological perspective when something is proven not to function .	c0qytt9	Libertarian

i 'm going to have to disagree with some of this . they 're rational does n't really matter . rationality in this case has to do with how people interpret information and behave based on that information . if they have no understanding of say economics or sociology or politics , then they might be rational , but they are still ignorant . the onus is on us to convince them agreed . just like the inventor of a new competing product , the onus is on the seller to convince the buyer to buy his product instead of a competitor 's or none at all . that says nothing about the product itself though . scoffing at them for having rational beliefs is n't rational i was n't scoffing , but it is rational to believe them to be and treat them as ignorant when it is apparent that they have not engaged in the prerequisite questioning necessary for solid belief systems . furthermore , considering almost everyone complains about the system , they have demonstrated that it is at least not an optimal situation . and when people perceive that there are problems and then attempt to alleviate them through the same methods that caused them , that is a glaring sign of irrationality .	c0jmwcc	Libertarian

in a true free market , with free market money , rising prices simply boost production which lowers prices ... ... the roadblock of inflation would never raise its ugly head . totally , irredeemably wrong . rising prices will have 2 effects ... a some consumers will drop out of the market , as they decide the product is 'too expensive ' demand drops b some producers will be tempted into the market by higher prices supply increases these processes continue until a new equilibrium price is reached , but this new equilibrium is typically higher than the old price , so the authors claim that the market prevents price inflation is wrong . in real life , the new production is likely to be higher cost than the old , and requires the higher price to be viable . we 're seeing this now with gold production , old mines that were closed decades ago as 'uneconomic ' are being brought back into production as the current high gold price makes them profitable again . if prices drop , these mines will be unprofitable , and will close .	c0slsvo	Libertarian

it means to apprehend real world concepts and order them into a coherent whole that is consistent with reality . i know countless human beings incapable of that . a lot of them are in politics . that 's not just a joke . coherent whole '' and consistent '' are very , very hard standards to meet . not that they should n't be met , but plenty of humans fail to meet them . no , babies do not come out knowing the sound of their mother 's voice . did you even read the link , sage ? it means there is no choice in the behavior . you have not explained what choice is , besides not instinct '' , if even that . i do n't like doing that because if you really wanted to know , you could find them yourself . oh i 've looked for it . it 's not there , unless i 've missed something . if you are unwilling to back up your claims with evidence , you are no longer discussing things reasonably . in the time it took you to type that paragraph , if it were so obvious and everywhere , you could have linked me , but you did n't . i had a class in cognitive neuroscience and a class in cognitive computational science and was given journals and articles that say directly that animals exhibit complex reasoning and abstraction , so if you are claiming counter to that , i do n't think it 's at all unreasonable for me to ask you for evidence . but language does not require highly complex , abstract mental faculties . ... what ? is that why it took over 3 billion years to evolve on earth ? a bird never flies exactly the same way twice . every time it flies , it moves slightly differently . their movements are novel '' . whenever the wind blows a little differently , they fly somewhat differently . their adaption to novel '' winds is novel '' . but nowhere is there any evidence of reason present . what would constitute evidence of reason ? what you call more highly developed , i call an ability that humans have that apes do not have . why ? by your logic , humans are only more developed than ants in degree , not kind , because it can be shown that both humans and ants eat , procreate , build homes , protect their young , etc . it depends on what cognitive process you 're talking about . when it comes to object recognition through sensory organs , it is only more developed than ants in degree . quite a lot , i would say , but the biological components are of the same type . ants , however , do not have prefrontal or frontal lobes , nor do they have a dedicated visual cortex , so their visuospacial reasoning cognitive processes are of a different kind . one is committing a huge epistemological error when one asserts that a theory must be changed just because the theory itself is not empirically investigable . ... that 's how science works . otherwise , you have to tell me why a theory that humans do n't actually have free will but are controlled by faeries playing a universal video game is n't valid . only if you reject empirically uninvestigable theories can you conclude that the theory is invalid . by that reasoning , if i ca n't read your thoughts empirically by looking at you , then i am to conclude that the theory that you have thoughts should be changed . by a misapplication of that reasoning , yes . for one , you can empirically investigate my thoughts by looking at me and listening to me and asking me questions , so of course that conclusion seems absurd your premise is false . the reason why the theory of phlogiston and ether were rejected was not because they were n't empirically investigable . they were rejected because they are investigable empirically , and the empirical studies have proven the theories false . what groundbreaking study proved that ether does n't exist ? it did n't happen . what was decided was that no evidence of ether existed which was n't enough , since lack of evidence proves nothing , but further , no evidence could ever be found because it was defined as a thing outside empirical investigation , much like god . one should never reject a theory just because one is unable to empirically prove it with current levels of technology and i never said that . because we lack the technology does n't make a claim empirically uninvestigable , it just means we ca n't yet . but if a term is defined in a way that precludes empirical investigation , then we 're sort of fucked and need a new theory . i am not inferring your mental faculty by virtue of your behavior ! then how do you know this ? i do n't have to know what is fully in your brain to know that you value writing on reddit to me more than you value others things .	c0sb3t1	Libertarian

but i feel that by making the choice at all , you are acknowledge your right to all land and all natural resources what i called collective rights . nb that i am not really drawing a distinction between collective and individual rights to control of all land , because the former is simply an aggregate of the latter . if there is a choice , then you are choosing between whether to keep or give up these rights . the very idea of there being two ways to go acknowledges that there is one way that keeps the rights to all land and another way that relinquishes them . if you are to say that this is in fact arbitrary , then is n't the concept of a right to your will '' arbitrary as well ? if a choice between keeping and relinquishing a right is arbitrary , surely the concept of rights is itself arbitrary ? i think we are starting to stray into mutual misunderstanding '' territory .	c0k3li8	Libertarian

the people will elect progressives over libertarians in any race you care to make . translation i 'm right because progressives always beat libertarians aka , argumentum ad hominem . we can fund education and healthcare we can remain strong and we can compete in world markets just have to buck up and do it . this is n't a coherent argument , its just chest pounding , it weakens your position when you forgo logic and reasoning right off that bat . the socialist '' bogeyman is a tired thing to throw around . if it effects enough people they will want it managed . its not a boggeyman , its a real ideology that uses coercion under the guise of the greater good . i do n't believe in violence or fraud , neither do libertarians . free trade becomes fair trade . i suspect those are just words for you . freedom and voluntary exchange are the only moral preconditions for fairness . once government steps in and uses coercion it becomes unfair and not free . wall street churn and burn capturing the rent gets taxed to the max . investing is fine day trading a crime . trading makes up the largest segment of american business . win lose trades pay ... 85 of wallstreet money is commissions on moving electrons . nice work if you can get it . and you would have the government use coercion and violence to achieve your goals . emphasis on your . the end justifies the means right ? libertarians think coercion is wrong , they want freedom and accountability . you want coercion and theft . no generational transfer of wealth we all play on a level field . meritocracy is best . we encourage everyone to do as well as they can and pursue life to the fullest . send your kids to the best schools money can buy take care of your widow , but no you ca n't build a dynasty . coercion , violence , and theft . i 'm going to be a father soon dude , if i found out that my wealth were going to be confiscated at gunpoint from my wife and child upon my death , i would leave . what would be my reason for working if you were just going to take the fruits of labor from the people i love ? you 've essentially made wills illegal . the best and brightest are n't going to stick around to deal with this kind of theft . you want to amass a personal fortune fine do not incorporate . if you are a publicaly traded company you will be regulated . ceo pay can not exceed 20 times of the lowest paid worker . the cost of doing business includes stewardship of our land air and water you will not pollute . libertarians like contracts and the accountability that comes with voluntary exchange . you 've essentially made accountability , private property , and freedom illegal while effectively abolishing the profit motive . where did you come up with the number 20 anyway ? access to us markets means you play by the same rules americans do . workers get health care retirement and education . if your workers are not covered your goods will be tariffed accordingly . oh so now you are going to enforce your laws world wide ensuring nobody ever invests in america . cool foreign policy you got there . you are free to have as much as you want just understand the rest are going to get a cut . you can keep you life , but i 'm going to use some of your time to benefit me . nice contradiction . you can not make money in a vacuum . access to markets is worth something . infrastructure needs to be built and maintained . civil order needs to be insured . the cost is education and health for everyone . incoherent rambling in this paragraph . this is just code for government control of basically everything . if you do n't like it find another reality to inhabit . ayn rand moves to mars ! and here you really show your true colors . you would use coercion and violence to maintain your society and everyone who disagrees will be demonized , coerced or worse . progressives have answers and programs not slogans and wishes . this was the best part . cool story bro .	c17uhvh	Libertarian
but to acknowledge your own fallibility and then declare authority over anything is nonsensical . since when did anythinganyone have to be infallible to exercise authority ? i would argue that every authority ever has been fallible . rationality morality . but a rational mind can figure out the best possible moral code to meet a desired outcome , based on whatever criteria has been established for what is good or bad . i do n't think there 's any less probability of a deity existing than not existing . the odds are not 5050 ... not by a long shot . any kind of specific god claim has been refuted handily , or relegated to the claimant 's personal feelings or experiences . the notion of a deity implies the existence of the supernatural something other than the natural world . there is a mountain of evidence to explain the origins and processes of the innumerable facets of realitynature , and not a spec of evidence to support anything supernatural . now , if you say that there is no natural evidence to show for the supernatural , and therefor we ca n't rule it out , then fine . i do n't rule it out , but it does me no good it is useless to me unless i can experience it somehow . to illustrate i can declare that there is an invisible dimension parallel to our own called the zorax dimension . we ca n't experience it in the physical world there is no physical evidence . but since you ca n't experience the extradimensional evidence , you ca n't rule it out . zorax has an equal chance of existing as not existing ! see how that works ? or rather how it does n't ? so just made up nonsense with no validity that anyone should necessarily be concerned with . desires are n't necessarily invalid . people should be concerned with subjective , fallible , and according to you nonsensical morality when almost all of their neighbors , friends , coworkers , etc . generally agree on a lot of it . saying i want , i want '' is immaterial in and of itself , but if there is reason behind those desires , they may be relevant after all . a deity does n't know morality , it commands it . now you 're applying characteristics to an entity you ca n't define . at the very least , there is no way to verify that the deity in question has such characteristics . you ca n't reject a hypothesis that something metaphysical exists on physical grounds . to be clear , i reject the hypothesis on the lack of metaphysical or any evidence . if there 's nothing but carbon life forms that spend their time eating and shitting and resting , i do n't see how morality could be done . because many of those life forms are rational , intelligent beings , capable of having and exercising a conscience . atheism denies metaphysics . it states x does not exist without any relevant evidence . you are completely wrong about atheism . atheism does n't state x does not exist . atheism is a response to a positive claim . an atheist is someone who does n't believe in any gods . i do n't say the supernatural does n't exist , i say we have insufficient evidence to believe that it does . it 's a 'standards of evidence ' thing . and if you believe in a deity with no evidence , then i think you have poor standards of evidence .	c0rslz0	Libertarian

'' go read it before you write these rants . if you want to enact true libertarian reforms you need to either reform the constitution or elect representatives who will repeal or amend stupid laws . but of course that would involve actual work , so it 's much easier to say that durrr ... we need to get back to following the constitution ! ! !

well i 'd never call myself a libertarian , first ! the parties represent the wealthy because that serves their primary purpose selfpreservation . the wealthy support the parties for the same reason . i guess part of my problem is that i 'm writing this from a balcony where i can see washington , dc . i 've lived in the dc metro area my entire life . it 's hard to be too idealistic in a city where ideals go to die . in the constricted discourse afforded our nation by the major political parties , it 's hard not to accept the lesser of two evils . really , i 'm torn . i was mostly concerned about fixing the health care mess . what happened does n't come close to doing that , but i 'm not sure what could have happened otherwise . i liked the wydenbennett act because it really would have done a great deal more to give real freedom to consumers . what did pass is imperfect to be kind . pretty much everyone in my family has serious preexisting conditions , so i 'm pleased with some of it . the health care mess needs more attention , and i hope the republicans can come up with more ideas than repeal . repeal ai n't going to happen because you 'd have to get less than 40 democrats in the senate . the last ones to go would be the most liberal . i have admitted before i am a democratic partisan however , i really do have a great deal of admiration for libertarian views . i would love to see effective political organization amongst libertarians . i believe the best way to make that happen is to work at the state and local level . i was looking into running for office in virginia . it only takes 125 signatures to run for the house of delegates . state legislatures actually have reasonably sized districts where a motivated group pf 1015 people could easily canvass the entire district . the costs for the campaigns are reasonable for an average person . most of the legislatures meet for a few weeks a year , so you can still have a full time job . that 's where to start . many of the worst regulations are statelevel regulations . it 's also a platform to go national . too much focus is wasted on bigmoney national politics when local politics is more doable and more effective . those moneybombs to ron paul were impressive . imagine what would happen if you delivered those to someone running at the state level .	c0uyf1o	Libertarian

i have never met anyone who did not support our troops . sometimes , however , we hear accusations that someone or some group does not support the men and women serving in our armed forces . this is pure demagoguery , and it 's intellectually dishonest . the accusers play on emotions to gain support for controversial policies , implying that those who disagree are unpatriotic . but keeping our troops out of harm 's way , especially when war is unnecessary , is never unpatriotic . there 's no better way to support the troops . since we now know that iraq had no weapons of mass destruction and was not threatening anyone , we must come to terms with 3,000 american deaths and 23,000 american casualties . it 's disconcerting that those who never believed the justifications given for our invasion , and who now want the war ended , are still accused of not supporting the troops ! this is strange indeed ! instead of questioning who has the best interests of our troops at heart , we should be debating which policy is best for our country . defensive wars to preserve our liberties , fought only with proper congressional declarations , are legitimate . casualties under such circumstances still are heartbreaking , but they are understandable . casualties that occur in undeclared , unnecessary wars , however , are bewildering . why must so many americans be killed or hurt in iraq when our security and our liberty were not threatened ? clichs about supporting the troops are designed to distract us from failed policies , policies promoted by powerful special interests that benefit from war . anything to steer the discussion away from the real reasons the war in iraq will not end anytime soon . many now agree that we must change our policy and extricate ourselves from the mess in iraq . they cite a mandate from the american people for a new direction . this opinion is now more popular , and thus now more widely held by politicians in washington . but there 's always a qualifier we ca n't simply stop funding the war , because we must support the troops . i find this conclusion bizarre . it means one either believes the support the troops '' propaganda put out by the original promoters of the war , or that one actually is for the war after all , despite the public protestations . in reality , support for the status quo and the president 's troop surge in iraq means expanding the war to include syria and iran . the naval build up in the region , and the proxy war we just fought to take over somalia , demonstrate the administration 's intentions to escalate our current war into something larger . there 's just no legitimacy to the argument that voting against funding the war somehow harms our troops . perpetuating and escalating the war only serve those whose egos are attached to some claimed victory in iraq , and those with a determination to engineer regime change in iran . do n't believe for a minute that additional congressional funding is needed so our troops can defend themselves or extricate themselves from the war zone . that 's nonsense . the dod has hundreds of billions of dollars in the pipeline available to move troops anywhere on earth including home . we should n't forget that the bush administration took 600 million from the war in afghanistan and used it in iraq , before any direct appropriations were made for the invasion of iraq . funds are always available to put our troops into harms way they are always available for leaving a war zone . those in congress who claim they want the war ended , yet feel compelled to keep funding it , are badly misguided . they either are wrong in their assessment that cutting funds would hurt the troops , or they need to be more honest about supporting a policy destined to dramatically increase the size and scope of this misadventure in the middle east . rest assured one can be patriotic and truly support the troops by denying funds to perpetuate and spread this illadvised war . the sooner we come to this realization , the better it will be for all of us .	c105nth	Libertarian

the difference is that some intangible things like debt , and even cash have a physical manifestation in the real world with real scarcity . other things like air and ocean water have scarcity , but are so abundant relative to the cost of containing and allocating them , that it 's not worth it to claim and allocate those scarce resources . other things like market share and labor have scarcity , however to control those like property rights implies a right to control the decisions other individuals have over their mind and body . nobody has a right to own slaves or for their business to have a guaranteed market share . however , ip has no natural scarcity . now , the time and resources of an artist or inventor has natural scarcity ... so a musician making millions of dollars from a concert is not a problem , but from an ip cartel is inherently intrusive and can not be done without violating other people .	c11vq3k	Libertarian

i want to see video of him saying this before i believe it . edit i am digging for the quote now , since this smells like a hit piece . the linked article says this now , in a telling political move , the son of ron paul has reversed his stance on the issue , telling URL the associated press last week that he is opposed to the legalization of marijuana , even for medicinal purposes. he also stated that he doesn t think the government s war on drugs is a real pressing issue and that he wants to cut federal funding for drug treatment programs . the linked tpm article says this what exactly does paul believe when it comes to drugs ? he wants the federal government to dramatically lower its drug enforcement profile . paul wants to cut federal funding for undercover drug investigations and drug treatment programs , '' the ap reported last week URL . he said he is opposed to the legalization of marijuana , even for medicinal purposes . but he also has called drug sentences of 10 to 20 years too harsh . '' that tpm article points to this ap article from 6 days ago , and nowhere does paul come out against medical marijuana in it . here is the relevant section '' rand will handcuff local sheriffs trying to combat the drug epidemic , and i will make sure kentucky 's law enforcement has the tools they need to protect our families , '' conway said . paul , a tea party favorite , shows libertarian leanings on drugs . he said he is opposed to the legalization of marijuana , even for medicinal purposes . but he also has called drug sentences of 10 to 20 years too harsh . '' i think drugs are a scourge but at the same time i also understand that teenagers people that you may be related to , people that i may be related to have had drug problems , '' he said last month . where is the actual quote of him saying he is opposed to medical marijuana ? ? i do n't see one ! just another classic hit piece .	c0x58qy	Libertarian

the concept of a government that does nothing is actually a positive argument the government would have to work to restrain itself and others from monopolization and tyranny . even nongovernmental entities like somalia today have local systems of order and justice . unfortunately , it 's the case that many independent institutions that have acted presumably in the benefit of individuals has become the oppressor of the same population i.e . corporations . that 's why anarchocapitalism is a very hard argument for me to accept .	c0wvifv	Libertarian

liberty is the ability to make the decisions i deem appropriate for any and all choices life presents me with . this interpretation of liberty is not limited by society , but it is useful to note that participation in a civil society which protects individual liberty necessarily limits options ... when i apply this concept to the health care debate , and specifically the so called solution '' which simply mandates that everyone purchase health insurance , i find that not only has my option to avoid health care , even at the expense of my own health or possibly my life , been taken from not only me , but as law presumably even from generations not yet born . the counterargument is that a healthy person making the decision to not buy insurance is limiting a sick person 's freedom to access insurance that would otherwise be affordable for the company having to hike up premiums . the response that i would expect to this is something like , why should you care about the unhealthy person ? '' well ... why should you care about your neighbour 's kids ? is it because you hope that by sparing them your demands your neighbour will be more likely to accept taking a reciprocal laissezfaire posture towards you ? by this logic , one 's lack of obligation towards the sick person is simply founded in their inability to hurt one . if i 'm reading the logic correctly , this is a highly dubious foundation on which to build a system of justice . one that leaves very little space for the recognition of the human rights of groups that have been thrown by circumstance into a weak position within the system . what argumentative support could such a weak person give to their claim to a bully that he should n't exploit her coercively ? if the noncoercion principle is taken as selfevident , there 's nothing else that she could say . she would be have to try to defend herself force on force . but most of the time davids do n't win they instead suffer and die . i want to be clear that i 'm not saying that we should instead found our system on state enforced pity or charity . libertarians have been very effective at pointing to how justice breaks down in those systems as well . what i see as the problem with all of these possible systems is that they take as given a specific , static and very limited notion of what people are and what they deserve . and for doing that they build into their structure the seeds of coercion and alienation of people that do n't fit their mold . to me then , a system ought to be built with a mind to creating as much opportunity for selfidentity creation as possible edit recognizing the need to reproduce the material base we need to function ... i.e . the need to be practical economically i agree with the libertarian critique that a lot of leftists fail to recognize this , but becomes some apples are red it does n't follow that all apples are red and scandinavia has n't exactly collapsed for having a welfare state . and since selfidentity creation is a fundamentally social , deliberative exercise , and the raw materials for selfidentity formation are the diverse identities of the people we can engage discursively , the system should be set up in such a way that as many different types of people as possible have the space , the freedom from crushing economic pressures , to enter the public square and explore . this to me is at the root of why i believe in some level of welfare state . i may have my freedom as an economic actor somewhat delimited , but the payoff is the increased availability of raw materials and space and time to develop who i want to be as a human actor . and i want who i want to be as a human actor to be what informs my decisions as an economic actor . not desperation to survive . and i think there 's a role for the state there as a buttress and cushion against the harshest demands of capitalism . edit but what 's key for libertarians to recognize is that the goal is n't the state . as soon as an arm of the state begins to act to delimit the public sphere and scare people back behind their defenses , it loses my support . in issues like these i tend to agree with glenn greenwald most of the time . the state , like the market , is a means to the end of a vibrant life rich with potential meaning to be explored . the above is really grandiose , but it 's hard not to be grandiose when we 're talking at the metapolitical level . so i hope you 'll be patient and try to respond to it on its own terms .	c0o7whs	Libertarian

but i ca n't agree with the vox pop nocitations blabbering discourse . calling elliot blitzer or whoever a sociopath or psychopath ... it 's childish . and it 's not really an indictment of anybody speaking . the nature of radio means they can not have citations or have discussions like that . but it 's nonsense . it 's 22 minutes of vitriolic , rhetorical , polemic , emotional nonsense . here is my problem . you say that you agree with a lot of what he says but you then call the rest childish nonsense . you cite one instance before you go off on a rant of your own about the nature of radio . this country is on the verge of economic collapse . this is something that gerald firmly believes as do i. so is his response emotional ? yes.. but nonsense ? no . matter of fact he calls someone a sociopath then he cites a reason why they are . he calls politicians crooks and empty suits and he cites reasons why . your closing statement in your response erased everything before that because you appeared to be discrediting the a lot '' which you seem to agree with by claiming the rest of his statements were purely rhetorical and nonsensical . perhaps my response was a bit harsh based on that . i was happy to see you say you agreed with a lot of what he said but maybe instead of taking it personal you should start to dig deeper into the issues . why does he believe that politicians are sociopaths ? why does he believe that obama is a fascist and not a socialist ? these are two things you probably cringed at when you heard them . but i would have thought the same thing ok whacko '' but not today . i used to be one of those right wing '' conservatives that blindly defended the war in iraq , i supported the foolish drug laws , i did n't care one way or another if a bank was bailed out . i was indifferent on many occasions due to my blind opposition to the left and support for the right . but thanks to people like milton friedman , ayn rand , thomas sowell , peter schiff , ron paul , gerald celente some of whom may be fucked in the head in some regards when put together opened up my eyes to the true nature of politics and economics today . and every time i go on the internet i find someone new to inspire me . but i did n't get that far by agreeing with someone on many issues only to tear them down because i had an emotional reaction to something they said . in your case , you hear certain things and you think they are baseless accusations or exaggerations . but you have to dig deeper , you have to find out why they are.. to discover if they truly are . on march 10 , 2008 , the new york times reported that spitzer had previously patronized a highpriced prostitution service called emperors club vip and met for over two hours with a 1,000anhour call girl going by the name ashley alexandra dupr legal name ashley rae maika dipietro , born ashley youmans . 75 this information originally came to the attention of authorities from a federal wiretap . spitzer had at least seven or eight liaisons with women from the agency over six months , and paid more than 15,000.according to published reports , investigators believe spitzer paid up to 80,000 for prostitutes over a period of several years while he was attorney general , and later as governor . this is a lawyer , a politician , a public figure , someone who represents the people . the same person who ... on july 23 , 2007 , new york state attorney general andrew cuomo 's office admonished the spitzer administration for ordering the state police to keep special records of senate majority leader joseph l. bruno 's whereabouts when he traveled with police escorts in new york city . so spitzer administration was tracking other politicians in hopes of catching them in their own scandal while spitzer was banging high price prostitutes all while prostitution laws were being enforced and people were being thrown in jail for paying for them . sociopath a person , as a psychopathic personality , whose behavior is antisocial and who lacks a sense of moral responsibility or social conscience . psychopath the prototypical psychopath has deficits or deviances in several areas interpersonal relationships , emotion , and selfcontrol . psychopaths gain satisfaction through antisocial behavior , and do not experience shame , guilt , or remorse for their actions . psychopaths lack a sense of guilt or remorse for any harm they may have caused others , instead rationalizing the behavior , blaming someone else , or denying it outright . k.. so are you telling me that eliot spitzer is n't a sociopath ? because by those definitions and explanations he is in fact a sociopath . once again , you need to dig deeper into the issues before you blindly call someone 's opinions childish or nonsense .	c139jsv	Libertarian

i think you 've been misinformed about the libertarian approach to some things . the entire credo is oriented around protecting an individual 's rights . the nonaggression principle is many thing , one of which is a device to prevent injustice . what 's being put forward above is what happens when prevention fails . many libertarians define justice '' as the undoing of an injustice basically restoring to a victim that which was taken away . currently , many times all you can have is an approximate restoration . it 's like buying insurance against a hurricane . all the mementos of your life ca n't be replaced , so they give you something else instead , often money . no one asks you how much the videos of your child 's first steps are worth tho . contrast that with the current system that operates not on a principle of restoration but on a system of revenge . how is this superior ? as to your last point you 're probably right that there are and always will be black swans that can cause whatever risk management devices we come up with to fail . even one as grand as a national government . the difference is that when a private agency fails , assuming the market is allowed to function correctly , the damage can be localized to that particular business and it 's immediate vicinity . when it 's the government that has to absorb the entire impact , the damage is universal .	c0odx62	Libertarian

just to add one economic thing to that , thomas sowell writes in economic fallacies URL about racism in a free market . basically the point is that racism hurts the racist . 1 one could be a racist employer such as hiring white employees over black candidates . this harms the company because they are stuck with a less productive employee and provides incentive for a competitor to hire the better , in this case black candidates . 2 one could be a racist consumer such as doing business with white friendly companies over black friendly companies . but if , for example , the white waitress or cook is less qualified than a black one , then the racist customer is harmed because the food or service will be of less quality . 3 one could be a racist employee such as only working for white companies . however , this harms the employee as a better position or more money could possibly be had by working for a black employer . and generally , the harm is proportional to the degree of racism . if you hire a white teenager friend of your family to plan a marketing strategy for your new product instead of the qualified black candidate with , perhaps , a degree in marketing , you will be harmed much more than if you hire that same white teenager to paint your house over a more qualified black painter . bonus the reason why segregation lasted in the south for so long was because it was mandated by the state . everyone was forced to follow it . otherwise one business could gain an advantage on its competitors by hiring a black manwoman that was more qualified than a white one or by serving black customers . but that was n't allowed in many cases .	c2qzu4f	Libertarian

when modeling those risks you are going to look at the mean and distribution of incomes in those fields . the entire distribution of salaries of engineering majors is going to look much more attractive from an investment standpoint than the entire distribution of salaries of comparative religions majors . simply waving your hand at certain majors and calling them worthless does n't always reflect objective reality . URL religious studies majors , for instance , were averaging 38k coming out of college . that 's not the 57k the me majors are making , but it is hardly unfundable . meanwhile , we 're looking at graduating seniors generally suffering a 20 unemployment rate . what goes is a 50k year job if you ca n't get it ? when unemployment rates go up , your degree matters significantly less than your gpa and your connections . i mean , if you want to take gates as an example , he did n't become a billionaire all by his lonesome . he had a cadrie of talented friends working with him , and he landed some very lucrative deals with large hardware manufacturers most notably ibm . had the contract gone to another firm , it would be john doe billionaire we 'd be talking about and his miraculous life story . it 's not even so much the career as the future job market that the loan officer will have to predict . and , ultimately , what it comes down to is a fundamental question do we want every individual 's college education to be a slot machine for some business executive to spin on ? or do we want to make education another basic utility that everyone can access ? the effort to offer public colleges and student loans was designed to make college universally approachable and affordable . not to make handing out loans profitable . these are two conflicting goals .	c2orngh	Libertarian

matticus was decribing a situation in which an employer offers job securitypromotion in exchange for sexual favors . just offering this would usually be considered sexual harassment , but it does n't inherently violate anyone 's rights it 's nothing more than an advertisement for an opportunity to make a contract . talking about sexual harrassment is difficult because there is no precise definiton , which makes it to some extent a form of tyranny . i 'll expand on your proposed right to not be sexually harrassed '' though . presumably , you are starting with the premise that if a right exists , it is the function of the state to protect it . but let 's imagine a world without the state would the free market be able to protect that right in any way ? by protect '' i mean punish offenders . in the workplace , the answer is yes the offender would be punished in some economic way . perhaps that is not an arbitrary enough punishment as you would like . perhaps not every offender would see punishment . perhaps these consequences wo n't deter all future offenses . indeed these are all true , but each one of these charges can also be made against the state being in charge of defending the rightpunishing offenders . i do n't know what the exact point paul was making . being that he 's not an anarchocapitalist , i do n't think he was making the latter . but from my understanding , the letters were written by a variety of people with a range of views , so i do n't know based on this quote alone . for all i know and probably most likely he was merely saying people should n't work where they do n't like the work conditions '' sort of like you should n't bring you lamborghini to places where it could get damaged or stolen . '' does it justify the damagetheft to your car ? no . does it say there should be no law against damagetheft of cars ? no . would it perhaps be a smart decision to follow the advice ? yes . edit walter block describes the idea very briefly in his great book defending the undefendable URL i tried to do my best explaining it but he probably does a little better than i can even the pinches that women are subject to are inextricably bound up with the state apparatus . contrast what happens when sexual harassment takes place within the confines of a private place a department store and when it takes place outside on a street one block away from the store . when a woman is molested within the confines of a private place the whole force of the profitandloss freeenterprise system comes to bear on the problem . it is in the entrepreneur s selfinterest to apprehend and discourage offensive actions . if he does not , he will lose customers . there is , in effect , competition between store owners to provide safe and comfortable environments for customers . the ones who succeed to the greatest degree in their antipinching drive will tend to reap the greatest profits . the ones who fail , whether because they ignore the issue or are unsuccessful in implementing their programs , will tend to incur the greatest losses . this , of course , is not a guarantee that pinching and other offensive behavior will cease . it will always occur as long as people remain imperfectly moral . but this system does encourage , by profits and losses , those who are most able to control the situation . contrasted with what occurs in the public domain , however , the private system begins to look like perfection itself . in the public domain there is almost no incentive to deal with the problem . there is no one who automatically loses anything when a woman is pinched or otherwise harassed . the city police are supposedly charged with the responsibility , but they function without benefit of the automatic profitandloss incentive system . their salaries which are paid for by taxation , are not related to performance and they suffer no financial loss when women are molested . it is clear then why most of this type of harassment occurs on the streets and not within shops and stores . he goes on to write quite a bit more on noncoercive forms of sexual harrassment whistling , staring , etc . see pg 16 .	c3cjiyf	Libertarian

the man has been running for president for 25 years and has n't even sniffed a major party nomination . let 's be honest with ourselves here and just admit that the average american voter does n't take him seriously , and find someone that the american people will get behind . not that obama was going to lose anyway . he will win in 2012 for the same reason he won in 2008 millions of otherwise apathetic black voters will show up to the polls and those who have mentally retarded children will register those children to vote and then accompany them into the booth and tell them who to vote for because apparently , mental retardation is not a disqualifier for voting . how frightening . to vote for obama simply because he is black . just like last time . then in 2016 , ron paul , if he is still alive , will then be 81 , and still too old . america will never again vote someone older than 70 as president . this is an overly image conscious country and only someone who looks young and robust , is n't white , or looks presidential , '' none of which applies to ron paul , will get their vote . neal boortz a few years ago likened the american political process to a beauty pageant , and that 's 100 accurate . geriatrics will never become president in this country again . that part of the american political dream died with ronald reagan . my original comment about america 's ageism being one big reason paul does n't have a chance stands .	c2ibofn	Libertarian

you must have a funny definition of success . '' is n't almost the entire western world at the verge of bankruptcy , without even having a world war to blame for it ? europe has been at relative peace for 70 years . yet somehow they are facing economic disaster unparalleled in human history . the usa between the civil war and wwi was a good deal closer to the paul idea of america than today , and it was in that period we enjoyed explosive economic growth . the usa immediately after wwii is also a good indicator . the postwar boom occurred when war spending ceased and the size of government plunged by something like 60 . we then became the economic envy of the world . i want to see the same pattern in my lifetime . i want to see the slaves and captives set free with an end to the drug war . i want to see war spending drop to zero . i want the scope of government slashed by 80 , although a mere balanced budget thanks to paul will be a good start . the us dollar will cease to be the world 's reserve currency in our lifetimes , and if we do not have a freed market when that happens , we 'll be looking at riots and poverty that will make us wish we were as well off as greece .	c3b2bxa	Libertarian

no . tax cuts , except in very specific instances , are not stimulus . so cutting taxes does not create stimulus . but your system counts the resultant shortfall as stimulus . when you take out tax cuts and the revenue decline due to the recession , the real '' stimulus amount is still 3 trillion between 2008 and 2012 , with more after that . we spoke with valerie ramey , an economics professor at the university of californiasan diego , who has done much research on estimating fiscal multipliers . she told us that income tax rebates are not very stimulative '' but that other types of tax cuts appear to have much bigger effects . '' ramey specifically cited the positive effects of investment tax credits , which she said are not captured by the simple textbook keynesian model . '' '' thus , based on the research , i would argue that the most stimulative types of policies are tax cuts that directly affect the incentives to invest and hire workers , '' she wrote us in an email . we also looked at a paper that christina romer coauthored in june 2010 with her husband , david romer . using narrative evidence to control for other factors that influenced output during the post world war ii period , the two economists found that a tax cut of 1 raises the gdp by roughly 3 over the following three years . romer did not attempt to quantify spending effects in the paper , but mankiw wrote in his national affairs essay that her results suggest that the maximum potential impact of cutting taxes may actually be up to three times bigger than obama 's advisors assumed it was during their policy simulations . then there is ramey 's own research . using news sources to identify expected changes in government spending that are due to military events from 1939 to 2008 , ramey found that the government spending multiplier is anywhere from 0.60 to 1.20 , depending on the time period and how the multipliers are calculated . '' we asked ramey to help us understand how her findings compare with romers ' 2010 results . she told us that the spending increases she looked at lasted on average for 4 years . in contrast , it is unclear what the average duration of romers ' tax changes are , '' she said . still , based on her review of romers ' data , she told us that i do n't think that one can argue that my spending multipliers are bigger than the romers ' tax multipliers . '' according to this , tax cuts are stimulus , and not just in a few specific areas . i also agree that it is hard to take into account the real positive effects of tax cuts using the perception of many modern keynesians . the idea that tax cuts do n't work because the propensity to spend is n't high enough is nonsense . consumer aggregate demand is as high today as it was pre recession . personally , i 'm not in favor of any deficit financed stimulus , '' since deficit financing takes resources away from the rest of the economy that could be put to actual , productive uses , if the borrowing is used to fund public works , and it if is used to fund tax cuts , it still has the same effect , since people are still trying to have their cake and eat it too . sorry , but it not bad math . again , try building the models and showing us how all government spending is equal . that is n't my argument . my argument is that there was more stimulus '' than what was included in the stimulus '' bill . unless krugman actually starts discussing the rest of the stimulus , he is hiding from the facts . period .	c220udv	Libertarian

a pure libertarian would say that the government has no right to take money at gunpoint from those who do not support such things and decide how to spend it . i am a minarchist , which basically means that i believe that a very minimal government is best . such a thing could easily be funded by a voluntary contribution if we still feel that it is desirable to do so . in such a situation , taxes would be incredibly low and people would have much more disposable income to give it to projects that they support . edit . sorry , i do not mean to insinuate that minarchists do n't believe my first statement .	c30xiz3	Libertarian

i 'm a libertarian , so i 'll see what i can come up with ... if we 're not including things like geolibertarianism as a valid form of libertarianism , then technological URL unemployment URL . i invite discussion here URL . otherwise ... 1. statelessness ca n't really work unless there 's no enforced rules . as soon as people enforce rules , there has to be a way to figure out what rules are legitimate . what rules will exist will end being created and enforced by the group that can bring the most power to bear . without the ability to easily discover truth and easily sanction others , an arms race is almost inevitable . dros become the new state . there are many potential conflicts that simply happen because of population and technological growth . one person wants to mow their lawn at 9am , one works third shift and wants to sleep . how is this conflict resolved ? at a persontoperson level , it 's easy . however , at any appreciable scale , personal interactions are impractical . 2. sometimes it satisfies more desires to deny something up front rather than waiting for damage to occur . an example is the bp spill . if they had to carry insurance or make a deposit to pay for their potential harm ahead of time , they could n't bribe their way out of paying the full amount or close up shop . libertarians are big on torts and remuneration after the fact , but it does n't cover cases where the harm someone can cause is more than they can actually cover . 3. voluntariness is a fuzzy line . people will only be good so long as it 's affordable . my thought experiment on this is let 's assume that the irs wage tax is truly voluntary and that you volunteer when you sign a w2 . however , let 's say the employer ca n't write off payroll otherwise , so the taxes get paid either way . this is , let 's say , because they have an ein , which is also voluntary . however , other businesses ca n't write off expenses when buying things from them if they do n't get their ein . ultimately everyone who wants to be part of the economy needs an ein or ssn even though both are libertarianlevel voluntary . libertarianism appears to make a very sharp and narrow line for what is voluntary , yet i see few libertarians actually living free they become consequentialists when the rubber meets the road . 4. humans do n't usually make decisions rationally using the neocortex and do n't have free will . this is a problem with many systems , though . though not all libertarians subscribe to natural rights , many do . if natural rights come from the nature of man why are only some aspects of man 's nature considered ? 5. humans have certain propensities that need to be factored into any system for it to be workable . libertarians rightly point out that communism fails because people are n't altruistic outside their monkeysphere URL'snumber . however , there could easily be biological reasons for trying to impose values despite disliking it when others try to do so to you . libertarianism could be as remiss as communism to ignore them . for instance 5a . political beliefs may be highly correlated with brain structure URL . see also this ted talk URL . 5b . primates appear to have certain URL biological URL propensities to be jealous of those who have more or who are taking advantage '' of us URL basically people are n't rational egoists .	c2o0y0t	Libertarian
i never said a thing about benevolent . government is a tool , tools are morally neutral . government is not a tool . the government is supposed to protect individual rights . name me a tool that protects someone.. government is made up of people ... and if you give them power they must be benevolent or else they will impose their will upon you . do you think that without government slavery would disappear ? no , because even a dictator can impose slavery . you pretend it would have disappeared . and all of this is a distraction from my point from 1865 to modern times states ' rights '' was a argument made by those supporting and defending violent racist discrimination . learn history URL strawman , i never said that . do you support government intervention in the lives of individuals ? if so , republican or democrat.. socialist or patriot.. you support soft tyranny . and how would lack of government give us nonviolence ? did i say anything about non violence ? i said without government we would n't be policing the world and propping up dictators in the name of freedom '' and democracy . '' wars should be fought by the people who are being oppressed . money should be borrowed for war by the people who are being oppressed . i 'm not an anarchist.. at least not until people educate themselves and understand the devestating affects of unlimited government.. in the meantime i 'm a supporter of limited government and the key factor in limited government is opening up markets and respecting social and economic freedom so people can stop being slaves '' i 'm a slave to the government and so are you .	c1bpqbo	Libertarian

people starving to death has pretty much been the norm throughout civilization . what changed in some parts of the world was the increased investments per capita , which led to increased productivity to more easily provide for the basic necessities , which left more people free to participate in a diversified division of labor . so , i would say the reason ablebodied people are starving to death is that their means to save and import capital investments are hindered by the selfserving policies of those who govern them and those who have colluded , particularly foreign governments and corporations , in that exploitation .	c1ouscz	Libertarian

there 's not a damn thing the tea party has done that even approaches the hypocrisy or evil that every single other mainstream group participates in . this is a point that deserves to be reiterated , if not for the sake of the tea party , then for the sake of the sanity and cognitive consistency of this society . i have no interest in defending the errant aspects of the tea party . i have no interest in playing apologetics for the moral inconsistency of advocating for smaller government and individual liberty while voting for the patriot act . i have no sympathy for the demographics of the tea party which show it to be largely composed of unscientific thinkers and partisan hacks . but let 's stop and think for a second . the tea party is mostly christian . just like the republicans and the democrats . the tea party does not have a fully consistent platform that addresses every issue based on principles and sound reasoning . just like the republicans and the democrats . the tea party has a small strain within the larger movement that has shown itself to be racist , hateful , violent , and otherwise intensely undesirable . just like the republicans and the democrats . would n't it make a lot more sense , if we are going to analyze the tea party in the context of mainstream political movements , to examine the ways in which it differs from the republicans and the democrats , not the ways in which it is exactly the same ? if our criticisms of the tea party do not extend beyond those which could also be ascribed to republicans and democrats , then the mainstream media and our progressive and neoconservative friends have been intellectually dishonest and irrational by portraying the tea party as a worse option than the republicans and democrats . it 's only a worse option if there 's some compelling advantage that the two main parties have over the tea party movement . what would such an advantage be ? dollar for dollar , democratic and establishment republican candidates received more contributions from corporate interests than freshman tea partiers did . issue by issue , tea partiers side with the constitution more often than democrats and republicans do . outside of the fully libertarian movement , only tea partiers have been talking about nullifying unconstitutional laws , including prohibitions on marijuana and the obamacare mandate . the tea partiers are the only people who have seriously proposed any kind of budget cuts . obama and the establishment republicans patted themselves on the back for proposals that might have cut all of 0.4 of the deficit , then promptly blocked precisely that . meanwhile tea party favorite rand paul suggested 500 billion dollars of immediate cuts and outlined exactly how to do it . while reddit was repeating the meme that people need to get out of their chairs and get active '' , the tea partiers were getting out of their chairs and getting active . that 's how they managed to cause such massive upsets in 2010 not against the democrats , but against the establishment republicans ! the tea party is a mainstream political movement , and like all mainstream political movements , i hate it . however , it is the best mainstream political movement to occur in this country since the gingrich revolution of '94 . and i suspect that it was really a symptom of a deeper philosophical realignment that will in the long term prove to be much more significant and much more libertarian than the gingrich revolution was . like fisherofmen , i too am taxed enough already .	c1kyz0g	Libertarian

so your model is something like a belief in bad destruction good and i would add that good in this sense means elevating the weak over the strong , as the abrahamic religions promise . neitzche has some interesting things to say on this , particularly the antichrist and genealogy of morals slaves do not want to be masters slaves want masters to also be slaves . a slave population was the fault of communism monarchism before it a slave 's idea of evil subverts the power of the master . the idea of evil is destructive and revolutionary in its function . i do n't think destructionURL is necessarily religious . i think it 's fear , an aversion to being preyed upon , which anyone experiences , religious or no . communism in russia was supposed to be atheistic socialist programs not only contribute to the superficial '' problem the importance is equipping the prey in capitalism we are predators of demographics by education and economic security . someone like me wants social and economic cannibalism to have no logical incentives . i do n't think that 's destructive . neitzche came to a different conclusion , though .	c1po3og	Libertarian

to me that whole idea is basically an impossible oxymoron . i agree , however suggesting voluntary socialism forces them into an awkward position of advocating the violence in their system , causing them to lose footing in their moral highground . '' instead of structuring things such that wealth is only produced out of altruism . i had n't thought of it quite this way , but since you mention it ... socialists claim humans are not altruistic enough voluntarily , but advocate a system where altruism is law . socialism wealth voluntary altruism coercive force free market wealth voluntarily altruism desire for wealth greed '' voluntary altruism socialism voluntary altruism free market . without getting into much detail they is little difference . ignore voluntary altruism ... what remains is that freemarket greed '' must be equivalently replaced by socialism coercive force to maintain the same standard of living . p.s . forgive me for communicating it in their terms greed i generally try to consider ways of communicating concepts in another person 's language .	c1pljw1	Libertarian

i 'm not sure how this contradicts or informs anything in my comment . apologies . i was trying to emphasize that all forms of government infringe on personal liberties as you were suggesting . i was erroneously assuming that most libertarians here leaned towards the constitution when it came to the issue of liberties , rather than liberty on its own . when it comes to state governments , this is where i often split from the pure libertarian idea . having a pure libertarian society is almost impractical , unless you have a society full of libertarians . i think as libertarians , we should recognize that some people wish to give up their liberties in exchange for something else shouldn t that be their right in such a society ? . you can t convince a socialist to become a libertarian maybe , but i am not good at it . local governments are the simplest form of government that gives the greatest autonomous control to individuals in a peaceful society . in terms of liberty , one local groups decision won t affect the liberties of another group of people . that s why a centralized government is the greatest threat to individual liberties . as for the gun issue , i agree that many would find it not silly . but i think it s silly in how out of control the issue has gotten when the answer is so simple . but yeah , i wouldn t mind discussing it later . in your second , you equate the people with a dictator . i was not equating people with a dictator in the way that you think . i was simply describing different types of governments . rule by law king , dictator , people law republic king monarchy dictator autocracy people democracy hope that clears that up .	c1t6g1s	Libertarian
to be fair there are religious jews not to mention tons of people of jewish descent obviously who are not proisrael '' shills at all . but the aipac types have been working very hard to frame the issue as here is the jewish view , our view . fuck international law god gave us that land . this is what it means to be jewish , '' and they have a lot of people actually believing that . really they are speaking more for the hardcore conservative orthodox jews , who are by no means the majority , but they are the most vocal about jews and israel , and always willing to loudly denounce more reasonable people or even just presentations of facts as prejudiced , antisemitic and so on . that kind of denunciation still carries some weight politically hopefully not as much as it used to , so plenty of politicians are still anxious to avoid it . also mr. scripes is right about the militaryindustrial complex . also , conservative evangelical christianity holds that the holy land '' must be completely under the control of the jews in order for jesus to return for the beginning of the apocalypse . they desire the apocalypse , because it will involve them edit the devout christians , but not the jews ! being removed to heaven while the rest of us will suffer through an enormous war in which the vast majority of earth 's population will die . seriously , this is what many of our political leaders and voters actually believe . after the war , the forecast calls for a thousand years of peace and joy , partly cloudy and with a high of 72 .	c2pxzx5	Libertarian

these are n't given '' to us . they are inalienable , godgiven rights i get that that sounds all nice and sentimental and all that , but sentimentality does n't get us very far in a serious conversation . you 've done nothing to contradict my point that in the state of nature there is no reference by which to demonstrate that these rights have some kind of actual existence . how about this , you tell me where i can go out in the world and find this magical list of rights '' which you think exists independently of our creating them . if two people disagree about whether or not a particular proposed right '' is a member of this totally real existing list , what reference do we appeal to to determine who is correct ? let 's try it in practice you think the bill of rights lists things with independent existence out in the universe . for the moment , i 'll just ask you about one of them someone comes to you and says that the right to trial by jury was granted to us by the constitution and does not exist apart from it . prove that he is mistaken . can the government give you life ? no , it can only take away your life . this is what a right '' means . no , that 's really not what it means . if you think that that 's the kind of reasoning employed by natural rights theorists , then you might want to consider reading what they actually said . you do n't seem to be even remotely familiar with the school of philosophy you 're trying to defend . to address what you wrote anyway though , what my position actually says instead of this incoherent nonsense about giving you life '' , is that what you call a right to x '' is essentially a promissory note from your government that it will not take x and usually that it will protect your x from others . in the case of the right to life , this means that the government will create systems to deter people from taking your life as well as punish those who do . there is nothing intrinsically incoherent about such a position , contrary to how you tried to misleadingly present it . like i said before , if you did not have such a promise , and you were in the middle of the jungle , what does it mean for you to claim you have a right to life , or a trial by a jury of your peers , or anything else ? if you come across a tribe of violent cannibals , how would the outcome be affected if we hypothetically imagine that in one world you have these magical rights '' independent of being promised them , and in another you do n't ? where do rights '' do any work in such a scenario ?	c5eff0t	Libertarian

you 're so wrong it 's scary . sandra 's insurance provider georgetown was free to not offer health care at all . this is like sooo many fallacies that are used to justify government interference . if you do n't like america you can get out etc etc . if you claim to cover health care , you are obligated to cover birth control '' . this is a simple plea for truth in advertising , and one i would think a libertarian would be able to respect . what are you talking about ? anybody should be allowed to offer any services they want and call it whatever they want . what are you going to do , prosecute georgetown for fraud because they do n't provide bc ? take a look around you , there 's not a single libertarian blog or website anywhere that supports these mandates . if this was a 60 year old man demanding his insurance coverage include a prostate screening , not a single conservative would have objected . yeah , i 'm pretty sure they would . i know i would and any libertarian would .	c40pr40	Libertarian

there 's a slight problem with this , at least on the surface . as efficiency in consuming a resource increases , total usage of that resource tends to increase , not decrease . now , this only directly works if that resource is effectively unlimited oil and coal , for instance because production of that resource will increase as its use becomes more profitable . presumably , though , once the supply provided begins to decline this trend will reverse .	c4qmaea	Libertarian

what you describe is making profit on the misery of others . economically , there are two scenarios that can feasibly occur . scenario a prices are not allowed to rise . as a result , the shops run out , and any remaining demand is not met . no one can profit by bringing in more in an expeditious manner , and can not afford to take the loss on top of the loss created by the situation , so the suffering people will just have to wait until another regularly scheduled shipment occurs , and hope that there is no additional cost to get things there , which would delay a shipment when prices can not rise . the result is the misery you wish to alleviate . scenario b the evil '' shops whose owners you think deserve cancer jack up prices because of the demand spike . only those with a severe need will purchase at first . seeing the profit potential for bringing more in , shops will expedite shipments or add new ones , taking on the additional cost of speed , as well as difficulty in reaching the destination with its damaged infrastructure . however , as a result , supply drastically increases , and people 's needs get met quickly , while prices quickly drop to precrisis lows as businesses look to take advantage of the opportunity and competition increases . there are other principles of conduct then economics . economics does not tell you what you should do . it tells you what the results of your actions in the market will be . and , like so many policies with good intentions , your results will be the opposite of what you desire if you forcibly prevent the voluntary market exchange you call profiteering '' . profiteering charging an above market price for something rendered scarce by dire emergency as the market price is set by both supply and demand , and we are seeing a situation with reduced initial supply and increased demand , profiteering '' is a logical contradiction . if people will pay the price to clear the shelves , then it is at or below the market price , by definition .	c4u0w56	Libertarian

first of all , a lack of moral values does not mean that someone is trying to do away with morality . for instance , i can take an epistemologically neutral stance towards morality , thereby supporting or opposing no moral system while embracing none myself . what 's more , if you mean moral values '' in a religious sense , liberals tend not to affiliate with a religion . however , they certainly have values , regardless of the metaphysical status that they grant them . the debate as to whether they are moral '' or not would be complex , suffice it to say that they do place a normative value on some ideologies . also , the difference between a specific belief abortion should be illegal and a value life is sacred is somewhat blurry , and i 'm not sure where to draw the line in terms of specificity . but some examples include the state should give assistance to its members , especially those in need . discrimination should be eliminated . systemic inequalities should be eliminated . positive liberty is , ceteris paribus , more desirable than negative liberty . traditional values can be detrimental to society e.g . the traditional emphasis on the role of religion in government should be reduced these are just a few off the top of my somewhat drowsy head . whether or not you agree with them , or believe that the means that liberals typically employ to carry them out are effective or ethical is another question . however , it seems a little absurd to suggest that liberals have no values .	c5gc1f7	Libertarian

the veeck decision was really bad law '' states , counties and municipalities do not have the ability to turn copyrighted works into public domain simply by referencing them in a law or ordinance as supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes , in quoting a character of charles dickens , said the law is an ass '' . the simple and straight forward , obvious ruling on this is that any law that incorporates by reference '' a nonpublic domain document is null and void . just as any private contract that references some verbal conversation '' i.e . non accessible is considered null void , etc . of course no court in the us would dare to make a ruling of that kind , because the result would be chaotic and it would be far too revealing of the utter farce that the american legal system has become . sigh one wishes that even just one judge federal , state , or otherwise had an actual set of balls intact and would be willing to make a ruling of this kind the opportunity to do so happens hundreds of times every single day . as an aside , one of the most egregious things in regard to this kind of law referencing standards bullshit was the recent virginia graeme baker pool and spa safety act URL , which among other things required , by dec. 19 , 2008 , that all public pools '' to have drain suction covers that were manufactured and tested to be in compliance with asmeansi a112.19.8 the problem was of course that you could not buy any such cover because that particular asmeansi standard was draftprovisional '' and the testing standards had not even been finalized . what ended up happening was that all the manufacturers scrambled to make something , test it to compliance with what the thought the standard required , and then all the pool ownersmanagers scrambled to get them installed ... then a year later , the cpsc ruled that probably 90 of the covers that had been installed were noncompliant and had to be recalledURL and the manufacturers of course , had to provide free replacement covers , but did n't have to cover the costs associated with removalinstallation . an insane headuptheirass law . and kudos to the people in this org for attempting to do something about it , but i predict one of two things will happen 1. nothing at all at least in the current equation this will simply be ignored as if they did n't do it at all . 2. everyone involved will be disappeared '' as domestic terrorists or indicted '' into the justice system on some other basis perhaps charging them with child pornography possession '' or something similar that will make the public turn away andor dismiss them , just as assange was impugned such things are easily manufactured by the government , and sold '' by the media this latter undoubtedly will happen if they attempt to escalate this further for example by scanning and posting the whole thing as a torrent .	c43a9ta	Libertarian

for starters , no fully privately funded and operated nuclear reactor has ever been built . all nuclear reactors are either subsidized or granted special immunity by the state . this is because no private insurer would ever insure a nuclear power plant , and because nuclear power is inefficient compared to fossil fuels . to make nuclear power cost effective , it requires state subsidies and lawsuit immunity , privileges only the state can provide . the free market would not create large scale nuclear power reactors . that said , the same forces that prevent nuclear power from being fully private today , would also limit nuclear power in a free society . since nuclear plants would need to be fully insured by private insurance before investors would commit , they would simply never be built . and if they were built , they would be regulated a thousand times more stringently by private insurers than by the state . a nuclear disaster would wipe out the insurance company providing coverage , so they would have a massively strong incentive to make sure nothing went amiss .	c4td5et	Libertarian

the problem i see in this case is that airplanes , unlike many other regulated services , if hijacked would represent serious , largescale threats of violence to everyone in the nation this is not solved by commercial arirline security . terrorists could simply buy a 747 and load it full of even more explosives and then fly it themselves into wherever they wanted . or , if larry page ever decided he had enough of life , he could fly his own 747 into wherever he wanted too . if this is such a serious threat , why do n't we see terrorists even crashing single engine private planes into places ? it 's fairly trivial to buy a cessna , and learn how to be able to take off and aim . it wo n't do as much damage as a 747 , but you could definitely do a lot of damage .	c4617av	Libertarian

if what he says is true that is , he was burgled 10 times before this then i would expect the police to have intervened . i 'm somewhat skeptical of the idea they would n't from my own experience the local force here definitely would but , assuming he 's telling the truth , this indicates that there was a major problem in how the law enforcers handled things . another thing i would have expected him to do was beef up his security . i know that , if 6000 worth of stuff got taken from my home on multiple occasions , i 'd buy a new door , set up alarms on my windows , and probably install cctv cameras as well . his notable lack of doing any of this seems to suggest he was n't vulnerable , he intended to take them on himself . using your example , i would n't expect anyone to not react badly . if i owned a gun i 'd probably try and arrest them myself at some point . if i did n't , i 'd improve my security as mentioned above , file multiple police reports , document the evidence , and then at some stage take the local police force to court if at all possible . probably around the third night i would contact a lawyer , if the police were n't responding to me .	c41orkn	Libertarian

last i checked the world is completely embroiled in tyranny , dictatorship and loss of freedom . that would make it fairly obvious that any system would have to have come through that process . anyways , libertarian socialism is a clear model of how socialism can work with free markets . i 'm going to have to go ahead and disagree with you on this one , though i think hayek 's position views socialism exclusively through the eyes of statist socialism . no , that 's wrong . you have to read the book to understand what he meant by that . in short , he believed that the liberalism of the 19th century , that created the industrial revolution and the rise in quality of life for everyone was being taken for granted by the liberals of his era , and that they were being swayed by socialist ideas because they did n't realize that that prosperity had nothing to do with the industrial and technological progress that followed , but the freedoms that fueled it . the original socialists themselves arised as defacto opposition to the liberal revolutions in the us , france , and other places . pre1848 and the spring of nations '' , socialists were openly arguing for dictatorship and collectivism as a way of eliminating freedom and individualism , that , in their minds , necessarily led to inequality and class warfare '' . only after the democratic wave swept europe in 1848 did they change their tune and turned into socialdemocrats '' and other nonsensical amalgams . there is no such thing as libertarian socialism . the two philosophies are antithetical to each other . socialists hold equality '' as their guiding principle , liberals and libertarians hold freedom as theirs . the equality '' socialists speak of can not be achieved without the use of force and coercion . no i 'm not . i 'm pointing out that people use moral justifications for all sorts of coercion including in libertarian thought . defining property '' is a form of coercion , because it enables people to use force to defend it . property is not necessarily achieved through force and coercion . initial property claims occurred through homesteading . heck , even in the 19th century , people were still homesteading land in the americas . defending property by force does not imply initiation of force . in that sense we can argue that every century before was an exercise in unabated individual rights to property . or that the advent of capitalism led to three centuries of colonialism , slavery , genocide and the worst oppression that has ever existed on this planet . in short , that route of argument is garbage . i 'd really like to read an elaboration of that argument . seriously , i want you to explain to me how the belief in free markets and free enterprise is responsible for colonialism , slavery , genocide and oppression . if that were that case then libertarianism is empirically incorrect . use of force and coercion are as responsible for creating liberty as they have been for destroying it . particularly when you consider the history of property which , for the most part , has been a history of people making claims to property then defending it '' against coercion and force of those who wish to take it . this paragraph really makes me question your self proclaimed libertarian credentials . use of force never creates liberty . if all men are born free , how can you use force to make them more free ? if they are not born free , what force is keeping them from being free ? who is exerting this force and why ?	c416288	Libertarian

republicans will defend military spending to the death just like democrats defend entitlement spending . both are inefficient , bloated forms of government spending . ask someone in military administration how well they think it is run . you will hear about frightening incompetence , endless red tape , and gross overspending on contracts no different from the peaceful side of our public sector . unfortunately when we put the two parties in a room for a year to cut spending , they came back with zilch . disgraceful .	c793w8z	Libertarian

if someone attacks you with a weapon , it no longer would be a defense of property , but simply selfdefense against deadly force . basically , if someone is threatening you wit a gun , you are free to use deadly force . as far as i know , no jurisdiction allows you to shoot someone solely in a defense of property if someone took your purse on the street . but there is the castle doctrine '' which allows someone to use deadly force in their home , and in some instance their car or work , against intruders . there may be other requirements , like the victim must reasonably believe that the intruder intends to commit a felony , but the gist is that deadly force can be used against a nondeadly threat . in this case , the fact that the robbers had a gun and shot the victim renders and castle doctrine discussion null . the women was using regular self defense .	c7ms6w9	Libertarian

retaliation for what ? against whom ? name one airline passenger or twin towers resident complicate in violence against the bin laden family , or any of the hijackers . you are condoning pointless bloodshed on political grounds . this is the shit mentality that gets little kids in israel and palestine killed on a daily basis . very nice slippery slope . it goes to show your very narrowminded view of world politics . in short , it was the result of extremely poor foreign policy . some examples include keeping egyptian dictators in power to give israel an arab ally . we supported saddam hussein when he invaded iran . when saddam hussein turned on kuwait and saudi arabia , we turned around and attacked saddam . we are now supporting a corrupt government in afghanistan . our support for israel . our government is not protecting our private interests , it is forcing them upon these people . and i do n't know who us '' is in this scenario . are you burning korans on youtube , then feeling victimized because the federal government wo n't allow americans in pakistan to take the rap for your obnoxiousness ? by us , i meant all americans . i do n't know what your obsession is with burning korans and youtube , but you should take it elsewhere . i ca n't believe you still think these attacks were in retaliation for youtube videos . it goes further to show your delusion . it 's in the american government 's best interest to imply that it was the video 's fault , but that simply is not the case . p whatever the fuck that all means . i stated a plain and simple fact . you ca n't understand it because it would undermine your entire argument . alqaeda is a front group for the militant members of the house of saudi to attack american business interests without directly involving the ruling family . and the house of saud 's singular goal is getting more money from its oil holdings . pretending like there 's some ideological agenda or religious goal just buys into the religious fundamentalist suckers game . they would n't attack our interests if we were n't forcing our interests upon them . this is n't an example of free market , unless you think a free market could be obtained by force . this is again , an example of us impeding on their lives , and a good reason why 911 happened . we are attacking their financial sector , they attack ours . we are n't forcing anyone to do anything . us citizens are engaged in free trade with the middle east . some saudis do n't like it , so they plot to terrorize the businessmen . the us government steps in to defend its citizens , and the saudis use these acts of selfdefense as justification for further violence . sympathizing with alqaeda does little more than undermine the basic tenants of the free market . again , we are forcing them to accept our way of life and they do n't want it . if they do n't want our business interests over there , let the businesses pull out . the government should n't have to go in and get involved in every affair . you my friend , are the one with the shitty mentality . i also do not appreciate you trying to discredit me by implying i am a sympathizer for alqaeda . i simply have the ability to unbiasly look at things through another person 's perspective and try to understand where they are coming from .	c78r2km	Libertarian

that is apparently your opinion . it 's not an opinion that is universally held . it 's generally a poor idea to use first person plural if the position you 're asserting is one that 's not universally held or if you 're not queen elizabeth . this is my assertion that we '' as arbiters or you , but i think actually all of us bear the responsibility to decide that bob 's reason to withhold aid in this situation is improper and thus compel action . the discussion of exactly what action is proper to compel must be handled delicately and with great respect for the principle we intend to violate . your conception of a principle '' is a vague sort of squishy guideline that should maybe be followed sometimes , and really the only way that anything is bad is if everyone '' were to do this sort of vaguely baddish thing all the time . '' my conception of a principle '' is a well reasoned guideline that should almost always be followed , and really the worst way to respect a principle is to follow it blindly without giving any thought to the consequences in a given scenario . now how exactly does that tie in with the nap ? in fact , how , exactly , does that lead to anything other than what we live in right now ? this is a very valid point and one that plagues my private musings constantly . the current level of intrusive nanny state we endure is a direct result of such compsssionate excrptions '' to principle . i wish to proclaim explicitly that i am not happy with the current state of affairs . i am seeking to find a better way through posing these questions . i very much appreciate your participation and hope this ultimately does some good . i could 've made some money betting that you 'd mention anne frank and nazis . i know , reductio ad hitlerum and all . but this is actually a wellknown example of the when a lie is not a bad thing '' argument . so i went for it . i could have used the terminator '' example , but i did n't . i should tell you i have an ethical standard that makes allowance for things such as lying to protect the archetypal anne frank , so i 'm sympathetic to your position . you 're just doing a really poor job of thinking it through , much less arguing for it . pshaww . here 's an insight to this whole thing math example ... people conflate the sums '' of ethical decisions with the integers '' that make them up , so they end up with utterly useless principles that state that doing this is wrong ... sometimes , or doing that is right ... sometimes . it 's the ethical equivalent of saying that 2 is negative ... sometimes . this may actually prove my point a lie 2 a good reason 6 a net good 4 . a lie 2 a bad reason 6 a net bad 8 . this is all imaginary numbers and perhaps pointless , but it serves as a neat little way of expressing it visually . how 's that for thinking it through ! so the argument you were prepared to present in support of the ethical acceptability of lying sometimes was that it would be acceptable if a single lie would save the population of the entire world ? to prove that relative harm should play a significant part in choosing between the lesser of two evils , yes . i would not , say , advocate lying to defraud investors of millions for personal gain , but i believe small lies to prevent hurt feelings are often appropriate .	cbh97jr	Libertarian

it 's well known economic historical fact that the percentage of personal income given away in charities has steadily decreased as taxation has increased , indicating people at least subconsciously feel the same way about money forcibly redistributed against your will . so you 're not really alone there . you seem fairly confident in your reasoning for why you do n't give more money away , so i wo n't argue there rather , it seems your concern is that this negatively impacts others ' perceptions of you . even if it does i 'd wager not , that 's hardly a reason to start giving away more it 'll only reinforce , in your own mind , that people resent you for being wealthy . i might turn your question on its head and argue that your libertarian views are a result of the way you think about giving . i certainly feel the same way . for the record , i donate time and money to a particular charity , but for a long time i did n't give much of any money away for many of the reasons you cite . i started working with a charity that funds a major cancer center in boston . the center has been around for a long time and is a world renowned leader in care and research . i joined a bike fundraiser that directly supports this facility , and 100 of the money i raise goes directly to the center . it 's very very successful in that we raised more than 36 million last year , for a big chunk of their annual operating budget . so why do i do it ? one , i like the physical challenge of cycling 200 miles over 2 days . i also like the camaraderie on the roads , and the hundreds ! of people who line the roads to cheer , offer water , snacks , etc . they make up signs like i 'm 10 years old and now cancer free thanks to you '' and it provides a very visceral connection for me of what i and my donors give to a positive outcome for people . so it 's very selfish for me , in a lot of ways , getting immense emotional and physical benefit , and the side effect is what some may call charitable . so if you 're really wondering , should i get involved in a charity ? '' i 'd wager you would need to find a charitable cause that spurs you to donation your time and money without a second thought , because it means something to you . writing checks for the purposes of buying off government favor in tax breaks , emotional favor in being able to boast of your generosity , may not be so fulfilling . there are tons of great charities out there , check out charity navigator URL to start with finding a cause that can be meaningful to you that is also not simply a place people throw money to soothe a conscience .	c8rnj9v	Libertarian

smh just wait it 'll get better . i am an american living in germany , and they have socialized medicine . works great in theory everyone has health care , but there are two classes . you have the poor and retirees on public health care , and those that have private health care '' , that they pay for or is provided by their employer . i , as a military retireedepartment of the army civilian , fall into the later category , as tricare , blue crossblue shield will cover me world wide . now the official party line is that it does not matter if you are on government or private insurance everyone gets treated the same not the case ! the government has a set price for every proceduredoctor visit period . for private insurance the hospital bills the actual cost and the insurance company generally pays it . the first example is when my sisterin law had skin cancer melanoma . the genetic studies came back that it could be genetic , and there is a family history . her doctor suggested that the immediate family all get checked now and yearly . my wife calls a dermatologist office and makes an appointment for her and her mom . she goes through her insurance info and gets her appointment the next tuesday . she then makes an appointment for my motherinlaw who is retired and on gov insurance , well we can get her in sometime in the next 68 weeks , we 'll have to call you back . my wife is alpha as hell if you do her wrong . she reminded them that it is illegal to put gov insurance on a lower level than private . funny they found an open appointment 30 min later with the same doctor . my personal experience i had kidney boulders ! not stones , they had to surgically go in and crush them , put in a stint in between my kidney and bladder just so the parts would pass . but every time i had to go off the ward for an xray or mri i would pass people in the hall that looked like they were near death , but i would go to the front of the line . mr. renob come on in ... '' i felt guilty as hell ! i was in pain but was n't going to die . some of the people in the hallwaiting room looked serious ! then there 's other things . as private insured i can only have one other roommate , and must have a private bathroom . others are 68 per room with a community bathroom . i get my own tv ... the gov folks get 1 tv for 68 people . if i do n't like the choices that are on the daily menu , i have a separate menu that i can order from , or order extra sides , not an option for gov folks ... chicken or pork ? as a result , many specialist have gone into private practice . they either refuse to see gov insured patients , or limit their hours that they see them . so now you ca n't get into see a specialist if you are on the gov insurance , so you are treated by a family doctor or general practitioner that is way out of their depths in treating your condition ! just wait 'merica it 's coming your way !	ccf7fjk	Libertarian

ownership of the earth is enforced by property norms . actually , a norm '' does not enforce anything . i literally wonder if you do n't know what norm '' means . within a capitalist structure , workers can become the owners actually the capitalist system exists to prevent workers from becoming owners , any workers who manage to become owners of their businesses become socialist are succeeding despite the capitalist system . despite capitalist 's absentee ownership of practically all the land , their state , their lawsURL etc . but under your system we can not become sole owners . this is nonsense . if only you use the land your business uses you can be the sole owner . under socialism , the land the natural preexisting thing of value is owned by those who personally use it . either as individuals or a group . this is n't addingURL force , but using that force only in a nonparasitic way . ie , an attacker ca n't violently deprive you of land unless you submit to their exploitative conditions . so if there are 20 farmers using a lot of land , they should all share ownership of the land not be forced to serve some idle parasitic attacker . the only solution as i 've said elsewhere is separation . which i debunked at least twice . why ? most people do n't even get into the property norm conversation it 's funny that you think you 're saying anything at all . hint stop saying property norm '' which is vaguespeak learn to say something . anything . this does have consequences and we 've seen them time and again under notso socialist '' russiankorea the fact that politicians endorse an idea does not mean they follow it . under the ussr korea the workers did not always own their businesses , often the state did , which is not socialist . lenin itself called it state capitalism , '' which was supposed to be a temporary period where the state acted as the capitalist advance building up industry in russia . lenin said initially it would only take 6 months . then it become a few years , then he died . while the ussr did not focus on creating socialism , they did amazing things like having a massive role in winning ww2 , first in space , etcetc . this is enough consequentialist argument to suggest enforcing this property norm straw man . those states are not the property system i am talking about . then you do n't actually care for what is good for people that 's not what i said . the fact that some workers escape exploitation , or even become exploiters , is not an argument to accept violent exploitation . you should consider the consequence of those actions that 's not an argument foragainst anything but a form of ad hominem . this has nothing to do with them selling their labor voluntarily i just previously debunked your point workers are violently deprived of the land unless they submit to exploitation . i think you ignored this because you failed to comprehend . i 'll simplify this . imagine if all the land belong to workers only , businesses would end up only owned by workers too . in contrast , if you deprive workers of the land they ca n't start their businesses must submit to the exploitation of the land owners . and they are not deprived of it under what i have proposed . if you are endorsing having absentee owners own the land and apparently pay a taxetc then workers are violently deprived of the land unless they submit to exploitation . that 's like allowing muggings if the muggers pay a tax . there is no separation for many people . absurd . what of my computer that i bought but use at work . personally used property , just like worker owned industry . the taxi , the work supplies if you join a worker 's coop they provide a taxi that 's personally used property . how do i determine what is my property ? personally used property can be enforced by the people who use it , thus if you overstep your ownershipviolence you risk some else 's selfdefense . if i start a business at my home do i have to be told suddenly it is a business by who ? in pure socialism pure worker owned industry there 's no one to tell you '' it 's a business . i am enforcing my land claim . as long as it 's for personal use not exploitation that 's persproperty .	ccrvr2o	Libertarian

you are judging an entire group of people based upon the actions of a few . first off its a job . people who go into law enforcement are n't transformed into a different species . second , how did you determine that just a few act inappropriately ? third , do cops arrest people for consensual activities ? drug use , prostitution , gambling ? they do , do n't they ? that is ethically wrong on just about every level . the people who are arrested are pursuing their own happiness a costume does n't confer any special rights said costumed individuals kidnap and torture these people yes being locked in a cage for long periods of time is torture said costumed individuals enforce unethical laws that create black markets thus crime . i could go on . if a person is too stupid to understand this they certainly should n't be carrying around a weapon . as a rule i do n't harm others . i 'm also very capable of protecting myself from harm as long as i 'm not disarmed . again i and many others do n't need or want government law enforcement to exist as a profession . purely based on statistics , you have an incredibly higher chance of being victimized by a black person than by a cop . yikes ... statistically the chance that a cop will ever stop a violent crime in action is essentially nil . so i guess cops are just revenue generators , or to be exact highwaymen . they go around threatening people and taking their money .	cbg719e	Libertarian

both private charity and government welfare create entirely different incentive structures . for government welfare , it is more or less guaranteed by law , and the force of the law is used to extract donations '' from the producing class of society to give to the nonproducing class . this creates an incentive for the nonproducing class to continue to remain in that state . this also creates a political incentive to increase or at least maintain this level of welfare spending , because in general , due to capital investment and improvements in productivity , the producing class is smaller in number than the nonproducing class , and in a democracy the number of people counts . this incentive is however , absent in the case of private charity , because it is not a guaranteed income stream . it depends on peoples ' voluntary donations . there is also no point in lobbying the charitable organization because it can not increase the amount of donations by introducing new legislation . this is the main reason why private charity is not as bad than govenrment welfare . all redistribution , regardless of the criterion on which it is based , involves taking from the original owners andor producers the havers of something and giving to nonowners and nonproducers the nonhavers of something . the incentive to be an original owner or producer of the thing in question is reduced , and the incentive to be a nonowner and nonproducer is raised . accordingly , as a result of subsidizing individuals because they are poor , there will be more poverty .

i have basic logic . and basic logic tells us that a wholly unrestrained company that had a free hand to do all sorts of nasty deeds that they ca n't do now i.e . stealing trade secrets , breaking the windows in a competing business , the list goes on could consolidate power and market share . ugh . folk wisdom parading as logic '' . why does n't your folk wisdom acknowledge 1 that all of those things can and do happen in the presence of the state , and 2 that competitors would be free to respond similarly , thus nullifying any advantage that could be gained by participating outside business norms ? in our current system the state certainly plays a large role in some monopolies . but you have presented no reason as to why a monopoly could not develop in the absence of a state . well , except that you ca n't name an example of a monopoly that has been created without the help of the state . but the thing is you 're not a professor '' at all . a professor has actually read the literature himself , and can answer basic questions that are posed about it . i 've read some of it . i 'm sure the people you dismiss have read some as well . but you are n't asking a basic question . you are asking how matter would behave in a universe without matter . you do n't want to see another point of view , and you should just own up to that . being stubborn is n't a crime . the literature is out there when and if you choose to become enlightened . but , either way , nobody 's particular familiarity with a subject is an indicator of its validity . that 's just basic logic .	cgt7psx	Libertarian

my primary point was that it 's possible to think that hobby lobby should be required to cover all forms of birth control without being painfully stupid . painfully stupid is a pretty low bar , well below correct . in my view , the relative importance of 1 and 2 are things reasonable people can disagree about . if we agree that they are both good things , then we need to determine which is more important in this case and that 's a complicated , fuzzy matter . that said , the enumerated points are a sketch of my current view on it . i did n't so much as assume 1 is more important than 2 as i judged it to be . part of what informs my view on this is that i am not religious and , quite frankly , i think the idea that fertilized eggs are full human persons moralitywise is a bit silly . however , i 'm sensitive to the fact that ideas of racial equality seemed silly to some people whom i know judge to be terribly mistaken . extending the analogy , i would of course see it as a businessowner 's right to ensure they were not financially supporting slavery to whatever extent they were able . but then i also consider the case of a woman who believes she needs something like plan b in order to not become pregnant . whether or not to get pregnant is about the most vital and important decision someone could make . they idea that someone , with health insurance , might be unable to afford the medication required to make this decision at this point anyway is fairly alarming . if economic times were good and jobs were easy to find , free market principles would work better because people who wanted access to this stuff would find a job with a health plan more to their liking . but jobs are not easy to find for most people right now and because of our odd system , people 's jobs are the source of not only their financial livelihood but their access to healthcare . because of that system , the rights of two groups are in conflict of course , principled '' libertarians will deny there 's a right to health care , and in this case i think the rights of the women in question are more important .	cio1d0y	Libertarian

the biggest problem in the liberty movement is that we eat our own . articles like this sadden me . can the author not find anything positive about the kochs and what they are doing ? must he join in with the derogatory smears ? the kochs did n't create this system . they are fighting against it , but it 's still the sea we all swim in . therefore any action they take in an imperfect system leaves them open to criticism from purist libertarians . the kochs are very helpful allies . i 'm sure the author could find plenty of positive things to say if he bothered trying . and i 'm sure his criticism could have been more constructive . i do n't think throwing the kochs under the bus in order to appease a dishonest smear campaign is a good strategy , or moral high ground just behavior . the kochs have been assaulted with the largest ad hominem attack i 've ever seen . they puts their money where their mouths are , financially supporting causes and candidates that will lead to more economic freedom . instead of engaging the issues at all , opponents have organized an incredible massive campaign to assassinate their character and smear their words , in order to distract from actually having to address the issues . virtually every one of us in this country has benefited from their company in a variety of ways . and yet they are taxed heavily , attacked viciously , and lied about constantly . and still they persevere . heroes .	cgm1jw9	Libertarian

the irony here is that the only people whose worldview is unquestionably sexist are those who presume the relevance of sex as a determinant of people 's circumstances , irrespective of the particular choices made by actual individuals . the pay gap '' you 're referring to applies to a statistical aggregation it 's the difference between the average compensation of men and women , respectively and does n't necessarily describe any pay discrepancy between any two individuals whose work output and career ambitions are directly comparable . the real objection here ought to be levied against those who treat people as instances of categories rather than individuals who have their own agency with which to make their own choices . it may be that the 5 pay gap is a pure coincidence , and just describes a pattern that happens to exist at the moment . if that pattern seems more resilient , though , it may point to a more correlation between compensation and some other , more fundamental variable that 's a product of actual people 's choices , and which is itself correlated to some extent with sex . if it turns out that there is a pay gap , but it 's the result of a more fundamental correlation between sex and the kinds of choices people make in pursuing their careers , then the inquiry ends right there it 's not okay to secondguess people 's voluntary choices respecting their own lives , nor to construe their behavior as a deterministic response to external influences , factoring their own will and agency out of the equation . anyone who believes that a pay gap pertaining to statistical aggregations is necessarily a problem has the burden of proving that it actually is because of sex discrimination that women who want to earn more , and attempt to gain higher compensation in the same way that men do , are being denied explicity because of their sex and not merely beg the question that the existence of a pay gap is presumptive evidence that such discrimination is taking place .	climai5	Libertarian

here 's how it happened last time medical societies like the ama imposed sanctions on doctors who dared to sign lodge practice contracts . this might have been less effective if such medical societies had not had access to government power but in fact , thanks to governmental grants of privilege , they controlled the medical licensure procedure , thus ensuring that those in their disfavor would be denied the right to practice medicine .

that 's not an alternative . that 's might makes right , or anarchism . no more than any other form of deregulation or privatization . government officers are still free to enforce basic tenants of good behavior owing a debt does n't mean exemption from the 13th amendment or that you can be exposed to violence but they would n't be free to act as agents working on behalf of imprudent lenders . the idea that the government can provide a small and defined purpose especially for things like civil law standards is well accepted . there is no reason for state agents to intervene in a private business dispute . private agents can settle the dispute amicably without employing government useofforce , or they can avoid doing business with each other in the future . it 's like the old mobster saying , if you owe me ten dollars you 've got ta problem . if you owe me ten million dollars now i got ta problem . '' that was actually a quote from donald trump . but it does illustrate a natural market enforcement on lenders . do n't loan out more unsecured credit than you can afford to lose . the only people using mafiastyle tactics are the individuals that believe they need to employ violence in order to secure a transaction . maybe but at least this way our government wo n't be endorsing conartistry and fraud . by involving governments in private business transactions , you risk doing just that . i again pose my earlier question of what you expect to rise in it 's place . i expect to see credit markets emerge that do n't loan out unsecured funds to risky borrowers . i expect to see borrowers that do n't borrow more than they can afford to pay back , because the debts are secured by other personal property . and i expect to see an economy built on transactions of real material goods , rather than an assortment of paper promises that rapidly inflate financial bubbles . this is SUBREDDIT . generally speaking most here recognize that the government does have a role in the free market . i would challenge you to go back up and post that question to the general community . while the generic sentiment is often espoused , you will rarely see any singular instance where government intervention is considered desirable or even warranted .	ckyvb12	Libertarian

'' of course do you beat your wife '' is a far less loaded question than how often do you beat your wife , '' as the latter assumes wife beating . fox news polls are n't always bad i 've seen some that are pretty straightforward , neutral who are you going to vote for '' type questions . but this one is a freaking master class in misleading poll questions leading to skewed results . we do n't even get to make an applestoapples comparison between obama 's results and the results of other major political figures , even though the poll asks a bunch of questions about those other major figures . this also gives lie to the op 's title . asking does this person ever lie '' is a very different question from do you trust this person .

i have no idea how you reached that conclusion . insurers have always had the ability to just cancel plans , willy nilly , for no good reason , obama did n't change that . the ppaca had made robust considerations to let insurers keep their plans the way they were , or let them move a little towards compliance , but still keep their grandfathered status , or let them update their plans the whole way towards compliance , all without throwing a single customer overboard . instead , insurers simply threw a tempter tantrum for political reasons , and canceled everyones policies . obama did n't lie when he said he would n't beat you . your husband , the free market , beat you . calling the cops suing on obama is n't going to make your abuser stop .

great , then these discriminatory policies should be straightened out without the need for an executive order . if the state is their onlymajor customer , and it 's really working to protect the interests of the disenfranchised , it 's even easier for market forces to intervene to stop this kind of behavior . if the government continues to patronize bigoted businesses , then their actual , collective morality is even more questionable . it really should be that simple . they just need to say , guys , you can refuse to hire whomever you want , but you 're not getting a dime of government the people 's money if you do . '' end of story . let those companies who refuse to respond to market demand die off and be a lesson to others . indeed , if president obama went in front of the cameras tomorrow and called these businesses out on this , took a personal stand , and then openly challenged all other decisionmakers to reject any business with these kinds of practices , i might even applaud him for it . but simply saying , the government wo n't allow you to live your life peaceably according to your beliefs , '' is ridiculous . that they be free to live peaceably according to the dictates of their conscience is the very reason america was settled , and the harmonizing of principles which allowed all those disparate beliefs to coexist led directly to the rights guaranteed in the constitution . beyond that , they are simply the natural rights of all people , to associate and contract freely . these guys should justly have every right to be utter bastards , to refuse to associate with or employ others , to live according to their particular principles , however repugnant those may be , so long as they actively harm no one else . please note , harm '' is not equivalent to offend , '' exclude , '' or even vilify .

i like the idea of fire protection being done by insurance companies . is that done anywhere ? look into the history of firefighting , fire insurance companies were the origin of the modern firefighter ... it ended poorly . fire companies would fight over access to hydrants while the buildings burned down , or sit and watch one building burn because it was n't insured by their company , only doing anything if it spread to the property they insured . about the tv and radio stuff ... i always wondered how they get away with both charging you for access to the cable channels and still bombard you with the same amount of ads as broadcast networks .	cgypqpq	Libertarian

there is no scarcity because they are sharing . i 'm talking about it in lower level fundamental way , and in that abundance allows for sharing , not the other way around . in fact more sharing decreases the amount of abundance , which is why you need high abundance to have sharing . if i have a cupcake and share it with others , each of us gets only a smaller piece of cupcake , the more shared the smaller the pieces each individual has , by sharing it i did not change scarcity . now at a higher level , what you say makes sense in the context of also sharing costs . so if a bunch of employees decide to pool together to buy a printer , then the cost of the printer is cheaper per employee , the reduction in cost and the potential increased productivity incentives the purchase of the printers that they will share . but at another level you can also see that the abundance of employees allows for this to happen , and the firm has to afford the employees .	ceksmwl	Libertarian

'' what if it does more harm than good ? as libertarians of every flavor , i think we can all understand the necessity of having a good nameURL well , what if the koch bros andor rand paul actually hurt the message , and the reputation of libertarian in the long run ? the ron paul letters caused enough controversy and damage no matter who wrote them . as USER says follow the money '' . to me it seems disingenuous to be advocates for liberty while still throwing giant wads of money at conservative groups for political gain whether or not that 's how the corporate political game is played . maybe we 're getting a bit bogged down in minutiae , but i think it 's important to have these discussions because not doing so could really hurt the libertarian cause in the long run .	cj2dc7t	Libertarian

it 's really both in a democratic republic such as america . 'the government ' is at least in theory an instrument of the electorate , but obviously once people get elected they are n't chained to the will of the public directly . the first is the democratic part and the second is what makes this a republic . so there 's a bit of shared responsibility . individuals are more responsible for things they do that deviate from the will of their electorate for better or for worse they 're due credit or blame when they do more or less than what the electorate expects . but i think the flip side of that is that you really ca n't blame them for doing exactly what they were elected to do . with 300 million people you can find enough people who believe anything to fill a government and blaming them for having bad ideas that happen to be popular is generally pointless and counterproductive . that said it 's not 5050 this country has a system with some pretty powerful checks built in against democracy being dominant . these checks are n't as blatant as the checks that were supposed to prevent encroachment on state and individual rights but they 're also a lot more effective . i 'd still say that people have some real and meaningful responsibility especially because those checks have been weakened considerably and i think that point was at least partly valid but at the end of the day it requires more nuance because it 's not really one or the other . actually republic is a mostly meaningless word but that 's the current definition	crarepq	Libertarian

that does not explain how marriage is under attack because of gay marriage . as i 've explained already this makes marriage more of a secular institution , and will undoubtedly result in religious organizations facing pressure to modernize '' . it ultimately will lessen the cultural significance of marriage , which to many has been a holy institution and one that the government had an interest in because besides property rights and inheritance the nuclear family has been the best way to raise a child . for arguments sake , i grant everything that article states , it still does n't interfere with someone 's right to get married . that is not the point ! it will result in an attack on a church 's right to marry or not to marry . it will already has resulted in an attack on the right of individual citizens to choose to not personally recognize another marriage as valid '' or as something they could support '' based on religious grounds . it all ties in to other issues that drive the breakdown of the family . and do n't think i do n't understand how it can be ironic and even contradictory that more types of legal marital unions will contribute to the further decline of the american family , but this push for new rights is taking an institution many still see as religious and making it decidedly secular . and the culture at large will only continue to change into one devoid of religious values , driven by secular consensus as opposed to moral tradition and of course the love of one 's self . it will take years or decades of data to be able to attempt to show the negative results of this , by then it 'll be too late . in the meantime ...

'' show me one other case where libertarians generally support that idea , outside of abortion . you ca n't . you simply invented a new rule that does n't fit with the rest of your ideology . just out of curiosity , where do you stand on infanticide ? according to ayn rand and murray rothbard , the authors of the nap , it 's perfectly all right to leave an infant to starve and die as long as you do not commit violence on the infant or prevent the infant from seeking food on its own . i disagree with that notion , but then again , i 'm also in favor of food stamp programs and i think that the entire nap is bullshit . i always thought it was terribly inconsistent to accept the legality and morality of abortion but reject infanticide . nope . prochoice , profood stamp people are arguing a baby is a person , but a fetus is not . antichoice , profood stamp people are arguing i.e. , the catholic church a baby is a person , and so is a fetus . prochoice , antifood stamp people are arguing i.e. , rand and rothbard it does n't matter if a fetus is a person or not , it 's not your responsibility to take care of them . antichoice , antifood stamp people are arguing a fetus is a person , but a baby is not . there is nothing contradictory about claiming that person hood starts at birth , but not before birth . there is something hugely contradictory about claiming that personhood ends at birth and starts at conception . which is your position right now .	cu49gez	Libertarian

i dont understand where the fuck my money is going . i pay for a government that goes to war . government gets involved and tries to establish peace and secure the peoples ' lives in a different country , i am cool with making the world a better place , if that works and i am cool with supporting the heroic nation of kurdistan that is currently on the front line of that war . but that does n't matter . because your money is part of the problem . because our money have sponsored the fsa which is essentially the dad of isis . this is not the government 's failure . this is the root of the problem . i am not a genius yet i know what happens when you arm , train and support rebels in the middle east . shit , you might hate me for that but i am not even anti war . i pay for a goverment that protects the boarders . whether or not you are cool with that , it does n't matter , because you pay for secure boarders and you dont have them . this is not the government 's failure . oh we tried but we failed cause they are still coming in '' . this is the government saying guys , we are letting them in ... and no , you are not going to get your money back '' . again , it does n't matter whether or not you want or dont want immigrants in your country , no need to argue about that . and now fucking this ? and that is coming from one of the strongest economies of europe .	cvmmxpq	Libertarian

the problem with that line of reasoning is that if your conception of property allows for certain violations of property which i think is totally reasonable , for the record , that still does n't explain why the state gets to be the sole violator . if it 's ok to violate property in order to build a road , then it should be ok for anyone to do that . also , i think the religious analogy works against you . morality long predates religion . religions have hijacked and tried to monopolize morality . similarly , property long predates government . governments have hijacked and tried to monopolize property .	crjs33i	Libertarian
there seems to be a lot of flaws in this article from article in denmark the top rate kicks in at 1.2 times average income . in the us that would be around 60,000 ... later ... maybe those minorities are smarter than then these puzzled pundits assume . maybe a hispanic family with two people each making 30,000 to 35,000 doesn t want to face a 60 income tax , plus a 25 vat . why would they pay 60 ? they are no where near the high income threshold . even for a family earning over 60,000 this 60 would only apply to income over this threshold . so a family earning 65,000 would be taxed at the high threshold for only 5,000 of their income . also different thresholds apply for families than individuals	cwvm7ns	Libertarian

i 'd love to find any kind of public education standards actually used by a school district or state which in anyway advocates a particular ideal that is from the last half decade and has n't been completely demonized . representation of facts is not bias or brainwashing . teaching about what certain philosophies of government are is not brainwashing . trying to create a story that pushes your own political agenda is . i have never seen any teacher , outside of their own conversations with students and side , tangential comments , require , as a part of the curriculum which would affect the student 's grade , require an answer that was either not heavily backed up by the general historical community as an accepted truth '' using lightly or not factbased . i have , on the other hand , had an economics professor in high school who told us upfront that because other professors in college he was the only ap teacher , there was one other regular economics teacher but i did n't know her school of thought or curriculum , he was going to teach us about libertarianism , and so we spend inclass time in what should have been the most rigorous of economics curriculums in a public school watching atlas shrugged '' , john stossel , milton friedman , and reading peter schiff . so if you want to say that public education is telling students how the state '' is good , when even our required literature curriculum , like most schools , included such books as 1984 , fahrenheit 451 , a brave new world , and lord of the flies , please , back it up with actual facts instead of designating yourself as innocent for telling little kids why they should think that taxes are thievery . i 'd say i hope somebody pens a story about how people voluntarily live in this country and illustrates the social contract , but i 'm not a total asshat and want to see vulnerable children taught philosophical ideas they have no foundation of understanding or interpreting .	crol46t	Libertarian

early americans killed the natives and stole their land , and used industrial scale slave labor , literally the opposite of respecting liberty and property , the central tenants of libertarianism . sure , there are wrongs in life and looking back in time without noting the norms of an age are a dishonest way to evaluate a world . who was the ones breaking contracts with indians and invading florida to kill indians ? it was the american government that was the largest killer of indians . it 's not like people making contracts to head west were rounding up indians , most that shit was just the government . if we compare today to 1777 and do n't even view it in correct context of technology and philosophical advancements , like how slavery was a norm most of human history , we see that people contracted with others on what they saw as a fair price for wage and this included rum as a wage . reading john adams 's writings we see him complaining of men and prostitutes drinking together , black men mingling with white men and also having sex with white prostitutes and the common folk generally having fun and taking the aussie way of life of working to make enough to go to the bar and have fun . adams complained a lot of the degenerates who left church and went right to a bar . besides the change in the quantity of alcohol the average american consumed we see that at the start of america most people did n't care about others and making them conform to their way of life , the average american just wanted to work so they could have a bit of fun . i suppose the government enforcing slavery and establishing that blacks are less than whites definitely helped create racism . still , reading primary sources on what america was like early on you see that it was very libertarian . most people did n't give a fuck about others and would think that us requiring a license and permission from government for anything and everything was nothing more than tyranny . i think early america was very libertarian , especially compared to other parts of the world and america had immense economic freedom . there 's no other country on this planet that could beat america in 1777 on economic freedom , not even singapore or hong kong . there was very little regulation from the state and most regulation and many laws were unenforced or unenforceable . then when we specifically compared the west during it 's anarchy years there was a lot of prosperity there and private law worked very well . yes , maybe you do n't understand basic logic ? if 'everything is scarce ' , then how is it easy or affordable to get land ? you buy it from the previous person . it 's not hard , i 've done it three times . you can also rent it from someone else , i 've done that a number of times . you also seem to lack basic logic if you believe moving is n't difficult '' there is infinite land available '' . actually , that 's not lacking basic logic , you have to be straight up retarded to tell me you actually believe that . i 'm really thinking you 're being purposely dishonest here because i do n't think anyone is that stupid . either something 's scarce or easy to get , one or the other , by definition it ca n't be both . incorrect . something being scarce does n't not dictate the easy of it 's attainability . you may incorrectly infer that water is difficult to obtain because it is scarce but you 're not considering the scarcity in relation to the demand . everything in life is scarce . there is a finite quantity of everything , but some things are harder to get than other things . your own anecdotes on the difficulties of moving are worthless , because you live in the oppressive first world , remember ? the one with all those awful populist protections , social safety nets , and terrible taxfunded infrastructure projects that make affordable public transportation possible ? give all your money away , move to pakistan and restart as a sharecropper , maybe then your opinion on bootstrapping and the virtues of an unregulated market will be worth its weight in horseshit . false dichotomy and ad hom but i 've come to expect as much . basic logic again . you really do n't connect the dots between your ideas , do you ? if someone 's sharecropping , and you raise the cost of rent to 1,000,000 or sex plus regular rent , then there 's not really a choice , is there ? basic logic says there is a choice . find another place . it 's not that hard . when someone raises rent to what i view as an unacceptable level i find a new place . quit trying to straw man me . you quote me saying i think people have the right to contract how they see fit and you say i support extortion ? please , grow up . and if the cost of moving exceeds what someone has on hand , then moving is n't really an option either . people move with zero money . do n't tell me that moving is impossible . people may not view moving as being the most economically viable option and may view paying more money in rent as being a better option but that does n't mean people ca n't move . our history books are literally filled with examples of people moving who would be defined as extremely impoverished . do n't tell me some asshole in seattle ca n't move because it 's too expensive '' too move all his material possessions . if people are barely making ends meet , what 's to prevent the landlord from keeping it that way ? it 's his land , he can charge what he wants . '' if you 're in a position where you 're not able to save , then you 're in a position where you 're not able to escape . false dichotomy . saving money has never precluded moving . human history is filled with examples of people who have no savings moving on to greener pastures . also , you do n't have a right to someone else 's land . your economic hardships do n't get to dictate how much he can charge . oh , now you 're denying that artificial shortages are deliberately created , like the california rolling blackouts created by enron to raise prices . i do n't see where i said that i do n't think artificial shortages are created . i literally said everything is scarce . '' you really need some help with basic comprehension and reasoning . that being said the thing that creates the most shortages is government interference in the free market . by definition it distorts markets . if an artificial blackout kills someone by causing a traffic accident or medical equipment failure , or you create an artificial famine to drive up price and as a result people in third world countries starved , yeah , guess what , that 's considered negligent homicide , which is magically violent '' . incorrect . enron raising prices does n't and should n't get charged for murder because someone ca n't afford their electric bill . by your reasonings then you should get charged with murder if you walk in front of someone , delay them , and then they get hit by a car 30 minutes later because they were slightly behind . do you see how you make these magical leaps ? with every word you demonstrate evidence of your ignorance this is n't ad hominem , this is just me pointing out that you 're a jackass who tries to hide his ignorance by slandering others command of the english language , which is ironic given you 've dismissed the definitions of words in dictionaries . you dumb motherfucker , i bet you think that sticking someone on a deserted island is n't imprisonment because 'technically they 're free to swim into the ocean ' . this is n't ad hominem '' uses ad hom you really are a special light bulb .	cwihsqd	Libertarian

the majority declared that state sanctioned marriage is a fundamental right , due to its central importance to society . the minority said that state sanctioned marriage is not a fundamental right , and that equality should come from legislative process . from robert 's dissent allowing unelected federal judges to select which unenumerated rights rank as fundamental and to strike down state laws on the basis of that determinationraises obvious concerns about the judicial role . our precedents have accordingly insisted that judges exercise the utmost care in identifying implied fundamental rights , lest the liberty protected by the due process clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the members of this court .	cskcuq7	Libertarian

and the upfront costs of building are expensive because of government regulations . rightsofway and pole access fees . 1. rightsofway for digging are important to ensure that companies digging wire are doing it correctly . i 'm not sure why you think anyone with a reel of copper wire and a ditch witch could or should be allowed to just start burying wire . secondly , absent government private property owners would have to decide rightsofway , which would mean rents and other payments , so i 'm not sure how you can say upfront costs are expensive because of government regulations '' because there are other factors in there . 2. pole access fees are paid to the pole owner , who is usually another private company . the telecommunications act of 1996 actually required that pole owners allowed for collocation of multiple providers on the same pole if the pole can support it , and the act also required that collocation fees not be outrageous paraphrasing , obviously . so , in other words , pole access fees are not an upfront cost problem caused by the government .	cx5lag6	Libertarian

ugh . you do realize that corporations are by definition a conglomeration of people that act a single entity , correct ? that people own portions of these corporations and thus receive revenues from said corporations , in which these revenues are taxed by the fed as income . so what you are really saying is , i think i should be able to tax the same amount of money 23 times before it hits the end user . '' you want to tax it at the point of sale . then tax it as corporate income . then tax it again as capital gains when it finally hits someones bank account . then you feel entitled to tax it again if that person generates any additional value on the arbitrary time scale of a year . which , is ultimately selfish and greedy on your end . also , btw this is mostly where the middle class invests , so by taxing corporate profits you are in fact taking money away from the middle class .	cujpvwc	Libertarian

still , i opened myself up to be corrected , and i specifically pointed out an avenue of attack that will convince me . i should at least score some points in that regard . most importantly , in health sciences research , every little bit of research should be focused on meeting some demand . no researcher should be working on something that has no chance of helping anyone . that would be a stupendous waste of money . you can make that argument that research do n't result in practical purposes and therefore do not turn a profit are not worth researching . but you can also make an argument that obtaining knowledge has value beyond monetary value , and if nobody is willing to take a loss in that regard , the net result would be a loss of knowledge , and that knowledge could someday , not in the foreseeable future has a practical purpose . but also , you can make an argument that what is good and what should be done can be in conflict with profit . cure for malaria for example . kills a lot of people , not terribly profitable because the poor ca n't pay . i see a net loss in knowledge that can not be replaced by a profit driven system , so i prefer the existing system with institutions willing to take a loss for some greater good .	d70qqqc	Libertarian

you pose a great question . objectivity is what makes science robust ! at this point , we typically have two sides to the debate those that agree that anthropogenic climate change is occurring and those that agree that either disagree completely or agree that climate change is occurring but that we have no effect . groups 1 and 2. group 1 consists of scientists from all over the world . they come from many different fields of study including geology , oceanography , chemistry , physics , astronomy , and of course climatology . these scientists do work for all manner of reasons , many are funded by grant money which can be completely unrelated to climate science . geology , for example , contributes by measuring co2 in ancient deposits which are n't usually the main focus of the rock cores or at least it 's one of many . sources of funding come from everywhere governments , private individual donors , corporations especially natural resource based looking for mineral deposits , and even fossil fuel companies funding their own climate research . it boils down to this climatology does not rely on climate change being real . it relies on the climate continuing to climate ! we will research it and fund research for it regardless because we still have to live in it . concurrently , the vast array of funding sources means that someone does n't have to say i believe in climate change '' to get funding . there are plenty of people looking to disprove it . the fascinating thing about science is that we 've tried so hard to disprove anthropogenic climate chance and we simply ca n't ! on to group 2 ! group 2 is a much smaller contingent of scientists . they typically come from similar fields and have a lot of good ideas about why the climate is varying to the degree we see today . some are n't even credentialed scientists and are just talking heads . make sure when you read theories that you know who you 're reading them from . some are pretty voodoo . anyways , none have been able to disprove that energy from infrared radiation is absorbed by co2 . that radiation is kept in our atmosphere as heat , which increases the energy in our earthly system . they also have one other thing in common . funding . funding for research that falls in the 3 is almost unanimously from the fossil fuel industry or a related field . that 's because , in my opinion , their job depends on it . if you 're a fossilfuel company , you do n't pay to show that your product hurts the earth . you pay to disprove it or obfuscate . anyways , i hope this helps . conflicts of interest occur in a lot of different fields of science , but they do n't necessarily damn the results . however , in this case , the conflict of interest is most certainly stronger on the denier '' side than on the supporter '' side . deniers have one source of funding , those that stand to lose the most . supporters '' are from all different fields with many different sources of funding , sources that wo n't dry up because our climate will always be around . climate change funding will continue to be a huge source of study whether or not the anthropogenic nature of it is proven . it 's an important field that affects us all .	d275j7q	Libertarian

well shit , because america has a welfare system to help the poor , we 're living in a communist nation . til . cause , i mean , redistribution of wealth to help those less fortunate is a hallmark of communism , right ? you 're literally doing exactly what i 'm saying . national conservative is as different from fascism as socialism from communism . am i arguing that it 's closer to fascism than , say , a centralist ? yeah , because it 's a spectrum . a national conservative does not have despotic views or those of a fascist . i 'm sure they 'd agree on a bunch of points , but again , a socialist would agree to aspects of communism as well without being one . URL look it up . do n't gatekeep conservatism by saying it 's not real conservatism . '' national conservatives do , in fact , prevent people from abortions . because that harms their worldview of the cultural traditions . national conservatives do want to punish flag burners as it 's an attack of their national pride . stop conflating terms . there 's a thing called nuance in politics , where amazingly , people can have different and similar ideas to other ideologies without automatically being a part of that ideology . it 's like getting mad at someone who calls a light blue turquoise because it 's obviously blue if it looks like blue '' .	dbexbgl	Libertarian

i fully understand your argument that the relative costs of the rich paying more in capital gains especially given loss writeoffs are outweighed by the potential benefit of instead using that money for things like social services . everything you 're saying makes sense . but , you ask me to elaborate on the specific economic consequences so let me elaborate there and demonstrate why it 's not so black and white . URL first , it 's worth noting how closely tied the amount of investment which is not savings , you 're right to correct me there is to worker wages . this applies to both capital gains and dividend taxation . more generally , capital gains impose costs on the economy because , in reducing investment , they distort individual decision making . this affects allocation of capital , availability of capital , and entrepreneurship . there is a rippling effect in play . these consequences do n't just negatively impact the rich , but rather they affect people at all income levels .	d2769yr	Libertarian

because they generally oppose laws that were enacted to help victims of racism . in my experience , libertarians take a very hands off approach to racism and think it should be allowed to figure itself out . if you ask me , denial of institutional racism being a problem and it 's effects on people is functionally the same as being racist , even if you do n't personally dislike or discriminate against minorities . i would be quicker to cal it misguided , but it 's easy to confuse with racism and truthfully , many people probably do use their libertarian ideals to thinly veil their racism . libertarians will cry personal responsibility , but deny that cry inherently denies the reality that minorities face social and economic disadvantages . even if a libertarian does acknowledge these disadvantages , they hand wave them by saying less laws will fix it , or current laws are making them worse .	d93l3ij	Libertarian

i had a similar situation back around 2002. i had traded millions in stock heavy day trading and made a decent profit but my accountant did a crap job on my returns so the irs used some crazy math to assume i owed millions in taxes . i was not informed about this until my bank notified me that the irs had seized all of my accounts . long story short i did n't owe millions , i owed 12k . the thing that pisses me off well , one of the things is that they informed me of a minor correction on my new return within a day after it was run through their computers ... so if they know to a dime what you really owe why in the hell is their default move to assume you owe insanity levels of money ? my guess is it is simply a tactic to sucker people into paying more . what they should do is send a letter saying 'this is what you owe , sign to agree or feel free to have a professional check our math ' instead of defaulting to the 'screw you , here is a bill for a few million bucks ' . but i think we all know the irs is not there to serve the people , it is simply a collections agency on steroids with unconstitutional power and zero accountability . but at least it does a good job of being the example i use to make the point that when the gov gets large it quits working for the people and starts working to make itself bigger and more powerful .	d5iho0n	Libertarian

increasing a price floor in the middle of that causes a lot of collateral damage . show me the research demonstrating that moderate increases in the minimum wage cause significant economic harm . the market is flexible , it can adapt to a huge number of shifts in the environment a moderately increased minimum wage is just one more such shift that the market has little difficulty adapting to . every discussion of whether to hire someone to do a job , now also includes a discussion of whether a machine will be cheaper in the long run . i do n't know if 10.10hr is the breaking point for that decision , i do n't run a fast food joint . and ? the machines get cheaper all the time . if 10.10 is the breaking point now , then 7.25 was going to be the breaking point in a few more years at most unless you are proposing some plan to fight the fundamental issue of unemployment created by increasing automation in the short amount of extra time that delaying mw increases buys us before said breaking point '' , automation is a really stupid argument against mw increases . now , if you were to propose something that actually serves to solve the underlying issue like , say , basic income as a substitute for mw increases , then you 'd have something worth talking about . increases in the minimum wage make it more difficult for them to expand past that , and actually be able to take vacations . yeah , uhhh , sorry if i do n't feel like the ability of one guy to take more vacations outweighs the importance of all his mw employees being able to just survive .	d9alhjl	Libertarian
from tiny house people to people facing evictions from their own property for code violations and even criminal justice reforms that targets violence rather than choice . these already exist . the pacific legal foundation , for example , fights many property codes . and there are numerous organizations promoting criminal reform . but i think you have the right idea . the libertarian party 's interests would be better served if it was a lobbyingeducational organization that promoted libertarian ideals rather than one that tried to get its candidates elected . candidates from the major parties should campaign us for our vote , rather than writing us off as a fringe third party . in close elections , an endorsement from libertarians could tilt things in favor of one candidate . that might be enough for them to try to cater to us in their policy positions . we are probably the largest segment of independent voters with a concrete ideology . also , it makes very little sense to invest millions of dollars into running a presidential candidate that nobody cares about . the libertarian party received about 1.2 million votes in 2012. if organized as a lobbying organization , that would put it among one of the largest interest groups in the united states it 's about four times as many people as the naacp has , for example , and more than twice as many as the aclu . and that does n't include people who identify as libertarian but vote for a major party for fear of throwing away their vote .

the perverse incentives the fed has being bankers , lawyers , and other people well connected to the financial elite are very clear . it should come to no surprise that expansionary monetary policy incentivizes investment and what group in america is very likely to have enough capital to make it big on investments ? the financial elite . one of the reasons milton friedman wanted to replace the fed with a computer was because of these sorts of conflict of interests . in fact , ben bernake made it clear that the fed does n't give a shit about most americans when he said economic inequality is not a firstorder consideration '' of how the fed should conduct monetary policy URL . now as a libertarian , i am accepting of a certain amount of income inequality but to ignore or not consider important the impact that monetary policy has on people 's wealth ie inflation being an invisible '' tax on the poor and working class and wellbeing is nothing short of fucked up .	d5i16nl	Libertarian

why is that suboptimal ? because use of force is wrong ? i might agree if you 're starving its cool to steal a loaf of bread but that does n't mean that stealing is n't wrong , its still a loaf of bread being stolen ? if voluntary donations is always optimal , then why does n't the private sector do that for everything ? voluntary donation '' also known as free exchange '' is obviously sub optimal to forcibly taking your money and giving you whatever i feel like in return also known as theft '' , if the goal is to get as much money as possible . instead of forcing '' people to pay a fixed amount of money for a gallon of gas , why not just let people pay what they feel like paying at any given time ? i must admit , i suspect you of being deliberately obtuse . no one forces you to buy gas , free exchange at the given price is kinda the entire point . you 've successfully conflated buying stuff from other people , with the government taking money to accomplish some end or give you other stuff back . the fact that some significant fraction of people do n't want the government to attempt to provide that endstuff , is completely morally irrelevant to you ? how is forcing poor people to panhandle in the street for several hours a day and collection dozens of tiny donations from voluntary individuals more optimal than having a centralized program where donors pay a onetime fee once a year and recipients receive a check in the mail onceamonth ? the system you describe would be better than the status quo if it worked as smoothly as you described , the question is does it , and does it involve any moral tradeoffs ? feel free to start such a program and make it work , i 'd donate ! i 've heard some interesting speculation about contracted bonds for social problems URL . essentially some entity creates tradable bonds , that vest as certain social criterion improve , the idea being that people buy up the bond and try and move the indices on that social criterion . the vested bond is then paid off buy the charitygovernment upon completion of that metric . now it relies on good design but its an interesting way of increasing accountability . first , private charity have a basic conflict of interest . their customer '' is the donor , rather than the recipient . which means they do n't actually have to make the recipient happy . they only have to make the donors happy , in terms of flashy marketing , big events , etc . and that 's why so many of the biggest and most established charities out their turn out to be total scams . that 's why you have megachurches where the pastors are spending their money on multiple private jets . because the scam charities can focus their budgets on marketing and pr . this is equally true for government ventures . they just have to keep the median voter happy and they have a captive revenue stream , so inertia is heavily on their side . if your whole thesis is that the median voter genuinely cares about the poor and wants to help them , then for reasons of basic economics , the oversight and iteration involved in competing for dollars of those motivated donors , will cause those dollars to be well spent , at least , in the consideration of the donor doing the donation . why do you think that the government agency , selected by the people , will generally spend the money better the shysters , also selected by the same people ? and how frequently would you have to see an issue before you reconsidered your position ? is your goal to take the money away from the people who would give it to the shysters before they can waste it ? can you see how people find that a tad paternalistic ? the problem is that you 're relying on the moral argument of but if jesus cures the lepers , that takes away their incentive to avoid leprosy . '' but it does n't hold up under scrutiny . sure it does and you do n't actually explain why the logic fails , fwiw . the mechanism of action is unjust , the outcome prone to fail , and the means to help scarce , then we should be leery of people coming in saying the government will do this successfully and the problem will be solved '' . its more like if jesus can maybe cure the lepers by punching unwilling samaritans in the face '' which is a slightly harder sell , and who know what effect that will have on how many good samaritans there are . you also missed a response to the other side of the question which is will the rich guy bother with smaller rewards if he knows it 'll all be taken away anyway .	d19osu1	Libertarian

from stagnant middle class and income inequality to child poverty and evil corporations , his analysis employs one step thinking and overgeneralization to draw incomplete conclusions . wow . it took some serious lackofselfawareness to write that . robert haig and henry simons developed the haigsimon metric . their metric includes wagessalaries , transfer payments such as employer insurance , gifts of inheritance , income inkind , and net increases in the real value of assets . and here we get into the free market hidethesausage . housing prices rise , creating a hard split between prehomeowners and posthomeowners . but we can make that difference disappear if we just conclude the millennials will eventually inherit the wealth of their parents . health care premiums have been rise for decades while wages are functionally stagnant . employees see higher copays and large deductibles at everincreasing premiums . but the fact that we 're getting less healthcare for more money magically disappears when you treat the inflated price as a benefit rather than a detriment . and so , with a wave of the magical wand of accounting , billions of dollars in wage and wealth gaps disappear ! nevermind you 're paying more to get less . the price tag on the merchandise says you just got richer ! according to census bureau data compiled by the american enterprise institution , 61 of families qualified as middleclass income in 1967. they define middle class as 25k to 75k per family per year . in the same year , upperincome families , or over 75k , only made up about 16 of families . fast forward to 2009 and things have dramatically changed . we have 43 of families in middle class incomes and 38 of families in the upper class . it s also worth mentioning that lower incomes declined from 22.8 to 17 in that same time period . and now more accounting tricks . fix a rigid income range as middle class '' , then watch as people crest the line between 75k and 76k and conclude everyone just became rich ! '' meanwhile , we continue to ignore the productivity gap URL in which workers continue to generate more revenue without seeing meaningful increases in wages . we ignore income growth by centile URL , exposing the lion 's share of income growth occurring above the 50th centile . it effectively attempts to disguise the real and widening income gap by playing with binary richpoor criteria that dictates your economic class plus or minus a dollar over an arbitrarily constructed line . child poverty is grossly inflated by how it is defined . in 2013 , the income threshold for public school lunch programs was 43,567 for a four person family , or 185 above the poverty line . sanders claims that children go hungry when they only appear to be going hungry simply because their families qualify for lunch programs . the details in a southern education foundation study note that the 43,567 income level is used to measure child poverty in public schools , thus grossly embellishing the senator s rhetoric . further number games , declaring the poverty line a legitimate measure of poverty but the school lunch program metric too high '' . why is the poverty line appropriate but the school lunch number too high ? that question never gets answered . sanders makes other unsubstantiated claims . he slams the student debt , despite most of it being held by the federal government . he repeats the minimum wage narrative with no regard for the voluminous empirical evidence to the contrary . he fears seniors can not afford their medication when seniors are fourteen times wealthier than the younger generation . in his view , a job lost to china is a job lost at home . his narrative does not coincide with scholarly research showing that domestic employment actually increases from offshoring due to increased access to goods . he claims the rich don t pay their fair share when , according to the cbo , the highest quintile of income earners pay almost 70 of federal taxes . another litany of ... what was it ? onestep thinking and overgeneralization to draw incomplete conclusions ? student debt is n't a problem for debt holders because a federal lending program exists ? was student debt a problem five years ago , when the lending was privately managed and simply government backed ? the minimum wage argument is terrible because of voluminous empirical evidence '' that concludes for those daring enough to peak under the link our review indicates that there is a wide range of existing estimates and , accordingly , a lack of consensus about the overall effects on lowwage employment of an increase in the minimum wage . ... lack of consensus ? medication prices that as the free market heroes like martin shkreli have demonstrated can run 700pill are n't a problem because the average senior is wealthier than the average college graduate ? that 's just sloppy reasoning on its face . outsourcing of jobs does n't put downward pressure in the us job market ? simply untrue URL . the article he links to concerns itself exclusively with the '01'06 jobless recovery '' under george bush and does nothing to address longterm blue collar job loss stemming from outsourcing that dates back to the 80s and 90s . unsurprisingly , a nation that outsourced much of its blue collar labor force a decade earlier was n't subject to downward pressure in a relatively minor slump . i mean , it 's bad . it 's all really bad . sloppy , badly researched , ideologically driven and wholly unworthy of serious consideration . but exactly what you 'd expect from a hardened ideology with absolutely no educational background or more than a googlesearch 's worth of experience on his favorite topics URL	czvcuzv	Libertarian

we 're talking about what is a libertarian and you 're dismissing the nap as unnecessary to the ideology stating that it only applies to a particular specific subset of it . yes , it is true that only some part of the movement focuses wholly on strict adherence to the principle , but dismissing it in this manner mischaracterizes and downplays its importance . what i 'm trying to illustrate with my post is the underlying origins and content of the nap . where does it come from what is it based on and so forth . this is not about just defining a strict textbook definition that you either follow or you do n't , it 's about how the underlying ideas of natural rights , self ownership , opposition to force , and so on are the basis for the nap and libertarianism as a whole . you 're right , not every libertarian needs to abide to the wikipedia definition of the nap to be considered a libertarian . but you 're wrong in the implication that the nap is not intricately tied to the foundations of libertarian thought . they are very closely connected and rely on the same fundamental premises . the nap is a fantastic distilled short hand for what libertarianism is , even if you do n't interpret it to support anarchy . if the nap or it 's underlying tenants do not resonate with you in any way there is a very good chance you are not within any reasonable definition of libertarianism .	d1z7r1u	Libertarian

because johnson is such a weak libertarian that he made it easy for me to vote reality this year . the reality is that either hillary or trump will win . trump is move away from hillary 's globalist government agenda towards nationalism . nation state government is smaller than global government . hillary will put anti constitutionalist and activists judges on the supreme court . trumps list of scotus candidates are constitutionalist at best , conservative at worst . he 's stated that he wants a court that upholds the constituion . hillary has stated via leaked emails that she will overrule constitution via executive order . easy choice . real easy for me because lp chose a weak candidate .	d8wnwzf	Libertarian

i personally am friends with a large number of leftists in seattle and san diego , as well as sharing some views with them myself . they hate democrats more than republicans . they are very painfully aware of the corruption and collusion the democratic party did against them to prevent bernie sanders from winning . it 's why the democratic party keeps putting up milktoast corporatist candidates they rig the primaries . most of them strongly dislike obamacare as well and fight very hard for universal medicare , figuring it will be less corrupt , actually help people and almost certainly cost less . i 've successfully convinced a lot of my leftist friends personally that a ubi would be much more successful and less corrupt than the current welfare system . as for income inequality , they 're mostly pissed that the people who ruined our economy never got punished and even got bailed out . they 're also against these trade deals that pick winners and losers . granted , their views also include things i disagree with as well , but there 's a lot of common ground . they do want the rich to pay more taxes , but mostly by getting rid of capital gains as separate income and getting rid of ridiculous rich person deductions that make it so the rich pay a lower percent than the middle class . i do n't believe in the income tax at all , personally .	dongeya	Libertarian

sexism did not magically disappear in the last 30 of course not . i am not arguing that it did . but it is systematic sexism i have to disagree with you there . while sexism exists today in american culture , systematic sexism is nothing more than convenient excuse to explain away realities for example no woman president in the last 45 elections that certain groups of people do n't agree with . i am open to change my position here in light of new evidence . if there really is systematic sexism in america today then please show me a law or statute , which is currently on the books , that is sexist in nature . if you can point me to one i will be happy to switch my position . it is easy to find examples of systematic sexism and racism looking back in history , for example the naturalization act of 1790 , however i not aware of any current laws still on the books that are sexist or racist in nature . we have come a long way over the years . i think a more plausible hypothesis as to why we have n't seen a woman president or why some highly competitive fields are male dominated is probably due to evolution . scientific studies URL have shown that memories can be encoded in our genetics . i think it is very naive of us to assume that thousands of years of hunting and gathering has n't had a some sort of permanent encoding in our dna . traditionally in huntinggathering societies women gathered and men hunted . gathering is a much more social activity and women would likely have gone out in groups . they may have felt really good if they were able to encourage another woman from the village , or talk someone through an issue they were having , while they were gathering . hunting , on the other hand , you have to be extremely silent so you do n't scare the prey . once the prey is in range you have to quickly overpower it and kill it . men were getting there dopamine hits by overcoming another creature . they bring the prey back to the village for food , but it also a trophy , a symbol . each day there are winners those that got something and there are loosers , this makes hunting extremely competitive . on the gathering side this was often not the case , typically everyone would come back with something or nothing in their basket . so maybe , just maybe men are much more inclined to go for a cut throat , back stabbing , game like politics , while women by and large just are n't interested in the politics game . i would be willing to bet if you looked at the past 10 years of federal elections house of reps , congress , etc . where a woman was actually on a ticket in one of the major parties and ran against a man , you would likely find that over 50 the time the woman won .	dlf8f4a	Libertarian

assuming this applies mostly to series i bonds what 's been sold since 1998 prior e or ee bonds play by slightly different rules depending on their date of issuance , but those apply mostly to the manner in which payout is calculated , not their usage rules for redemption that said the minimum holding period for a series i bond is 12 months . it may be redeemed anytime thereafter . the following is from the treasury dept 's page on bonds and bond redemption ... i bonds increase in value on the first day of each month , and interest is compounded semiannually based on each i bond 's issue date . an i bond 's issue date is the month and year in which an i bond issuing agent receives the full issue price . you can cash your series i bonds anytime after 12 months . you receive the original purchase price plus interest earnings . i bonds are meant to be longerterm investments if you redeem an i bond within the first 5 years , you 'll lose your last 3 months interest . for example , if you redeem an i bond after 18 months , you 'll receive the first 15 months of interest . which seems punitive enough to deter people from the practice in and of itself ... edit started to go off on a tinfoilhat backed by data though rant about how the cpi , especially chain cpi is a totally bullshit number and why i would n't want to touch an investment that uses the cpiu to determine what you 're owed to compensate for inflation ie i feel that it greatly underestimates the real inflation rate just look at anyone on fixed income due to social security and see how you feel about those checks vs real world inflation ss predominately uses cpiu to calculate payout , which among other things does n't much account for the price of staple food products ... and is more based on housing and healthcare costs , which come from other government metrics that are equally fucky and abstracted ... . i 'll save that for some other time though as it is greatly outside of the scope of the straightforward question you asked ...	df4od50	Libertarian

perhaps this is n't the libertarian response i am new to postingcommenting here and to reddit as a whole really ... but i would see it as each individual has the right to enter a voluntary transaction with another individual perhaps an employer and so long as this does not infringe on another 's rights to exchange their time labour , and skillset for something money , for a common example . the agreement that the individual makes with their employer does not necessarily have to equate to the entire value of what said labour produces . if that were the case then the employer would not see the value from their work setting up the company so as to accomodate the employment of labourers in the first place or even the company 's value such as it can produce a good or service for its customers who wish to engage in transactions with that company . if somebody with the mindset of yourself had interest in attaining a higher value for your labour whether by or retained of your labour 's true value '' as measured by exactly what you produce then my suggestion , as well as the capitalistlibertarian outlook , would be to start up a small business and employ labourers at a rate which they are happy to voluntarily engage in a transaction with you and provide their work while you as the employer will still be able to leave enough profits to grow or maintain your business while still earning a substantive income . i apologize for the nonconcise ramble but my tl dr would be this the transaction of labourwork from an employee to an employer must be voluntary as long as the outcome is agreed upon by employer and employee and no coercion or force is used to force the labour to occur then we are operating in a just and fair manner . no , of course we do not hold 100 of the fruits of our labour what we do enjoy , however , is the freedom to engage in voluntary transactions to exchange our labour for a fee which we deem as appropriate or fair based upon circumstances such as experience , skill , difficulty of task etc .	drhwmm4	Libertarian

shapiro was hired a few weeks before breitbart died , and then it became , as you say a very different animal '' ? so yeah , he joined a few weeks before it all went bad , and then stayed there for 4 years . through milo being hired . through the support of bain showing up with weapons to mosques . through the blackcrime hashtag . URL as to what two things are not fair to conflate ben shapiro supports small government , religious liberty and freemarket economics . that makes him a 'fascist . ' with what the antifa guy was actually yelling shapiro , one of the architects and founders and ideological foundations of this fascist regime is speaking . ben shapiro , who says things like 'arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage . ' it 's still pretty ridiculous to call him an outright fascist , but it 's also ridiculous to think he 's being called that for his support of small government , religious liberty , and free market economics . '' he 's been tarred because of some of the icendiary things he has said and what propaganda newspaper he was editoratlarge for 4 years for not just a reporter . in terms of andrew breitbart '' he delighted in the enraged outburst , the shouted insult , the videotaped jab of a finger into an opponent 's chest . '' mr . breitbart , as much as anyone , turned the web into an assault rifle , helping to bring down acorn , a community organizing group , with the strategic release of undercover videos made by james o keefe , a conservative activist forcing shirley sherrod , an agriculture department official , out of her job with a misleadingly edited clip of a speech and flushing out representive anthony d. weiner , democrat of new york , when he tried to lie about lewd pictures he had sent via twitter . less watchdog than pit bull and one who , without the technology of the 21st century , might have been just one more angry man shouting from a street corner , mr. breitbart altered the rules of civil discourse . mark feldstein , a journalism professor at the university of maryland , said that mr. breitbart used the tools of invective and polemic to change the conversation , to try to turn it to his advantage. so excuse me if i do n't exactly have the vapors about how insane it is to ben shapiro that civil discourse has broken down to a point where people yell fascist '' at each other . on top of that using a buckley vs baldwin speech ? it 's all so insanely ironic . bad leadership , bad icons , bad arguments . all being upvoted in an identity war political bubble . ridiculous .	dn0r26m	Libertarian

all of the nations you mentioned have privately owned means of production . i mentioned exactly 2 singapore and the u.s. singapore has both private and public ownership of the means of production the situation in the u.s. is a bit hairier . singapore , despite having some nationalized industries , is mostly capitalistic by your own definition . yes it is , but i would n't point to it as a shining example of capitalism . if it were purely capitalistic , the state would n't own most of the land and such a significant share of the market . i do n't think it 's controversial to say it is more socialistic '' than other developed nations . yes , referring to everything bad as socialism , as many do , dilutes the definition , and so does referring to any government intervention in a market economy as socialism , which is what you 're doing . why do you think i 'm doing that ? all i 've done is clarify that market transactions would work the same regardless of who owns the means of production . if all or at least the vast majority of the means of production are not collectively owned , it 's not socialism . it 's a market economy , with privately owned means of production , and some government intervention ... regulated , traditional capitalism . i do n't think this is a productive definition , as this seems to mean everything except for communism including feudal economies is actually capitalism . and i do n't even know where things like centralized economies would fit in , since you described all nonsocialist economies as market economies . i think a more productive and traditional perspective is to view capitalism and socialism as two poles , with almost all economies falling on a spectrum between them . do you not see that what you are doing is exaclty what you 're complaining about ? you 're obfuscating the terminology . you keep accusing me of saying things i have n't said , and you 're constantly changing your own terminology . i have been using the same definitions to make the same point this entire time . i think you 're projecting here .	dpe486a	Libertarian

the best yes , best way to gain more leverage for the majority is to increase government i think this is just factually wrong . and not just wrong but 180 wrong . the history of the western world has shown that the bigger government is , the more the rich and powerful tend to control it . and when the government controls something , there s no way for the common person to avoid getting burned by it other than by going to prison . obviously , increasing the government in a way that benefits the common man is what everyone who votes for a large state is picturing . but the reality is that it doesn t actually work out that way . larger government almost always comes with increased protections for the rich and powerful , which prevent them from experiencing the ravages of competition , which then increases their power and wealth . true capitalism certainly isn t perfect for the middle class , but at least rich capitalists end up spending a lot of energy fighting each other because of competition most of the largest companies today didn t even exist 50 years ago and most probably won t exist 50 years from now , etc . and as a normal person , when a capitalist does something you don t like , you can at least refuse to buy or sell without ending up in prison . sometimes that s not easy , but at least you have that option .	dryb6ik	Libertarian

how is a monopoly impossible in free market competition ? without regulation , you just integrate horizontally and vertically until you outcompete everything and can buy out and sabotage your competition , isolating the consumer in a market of your creation . you can do that by being a good '' company until you have a large enough market share to overcome market influences . it 's happened in the past . you also assume that there will be perfect information in the system . what if a company produces suffering in a hidden way to produce savings for the consumer ? without inspection , certification , and labor laws you ca n't , as a consumer , simply use the free market to enforce your ethics . unless every citizen is also an investigative journalist , there is no way to guarantee that the companies you patronize abide by a basic level of decency . this will help companies to isolate you in the market because without regulation with teeth , there are many ways to cut corners that are essentially invisible to consumers . the current system also exports sufferingenvironmental damage in ways that are largely invisible to consumers , but i know for a fact that there are n't children back in the kitchen at mcdonald 's , i know that even our corrupt and sleazy banks are being forced to have a certain amount of cash on hand . i know that the natural gas companies operating in the us will have occasional inspections that will sometimes catch them doing awful shit and fine themshut them down . these things are not because of consumer power and choice on the part of the companies , they are a leash held by the federal government to reign in the incentives of free market capitalism . they are a social contract you sign when you do business in america . it 's not a perfect contract , but at least it covers some basic decency .	drpf74p	Libertarian

the problem is that our taxes do n't actually guarantee good education or quality of life for ourselves and those around us . look at how terrible american schools are doing compared to other developed countries , this is despite the fact that the us federal government taxes more money than almost any country in the world . america has such a ridiculous amount of wealth and yet we ca n't even come close to being at the top of the world 's educational or health hierarchy obesity epidemic . social security is n't even close to enough to live on for the average retired person , and its a system that discourages saving for retirement leading to the epidemic of more people aged 65 having to work now than they did 10 or 15 years ago . again this is occurring when we are at record levels of wealth being taxed . the government continues to borrow and tax and spend exorbiant amounts of capital at record levels yet our national life expectancy has stopped rising , our schools are decreasing in quality , college costs more than ever while providing less utility in the job market than ever , and retirees do n't actually get to retire . at the same time more people than ever before are abusing systems like social security and disability among others because now entire generations have been born and raised as welfare families '' . seems to me that taking the stance that taxation is working out great for our fellow man is complacent at best and immoral and unconstitutional at worst .	dur19uh	Libertarian

they have still been bankrupting the country at the federal level . the reagan tax cuts produced the first rise in debt to gdp ratio since ww2 and every tax cut since than has caused the debt to gdp ratio to trend upwards . also more infrastructure spending used to originate at the federal level . it 's partially why the u.s. infrastructure has been slowly crumbling the past several decades . republican state governments have been cutting taxes and school funding . kansas in particular has done this . after the substantial tax cuts several years ago caused a budget surplus to turn into a deficit , they cut school spending to the point where many districts only had school four days a week . it should be no surprise that generally the states with the worst school systems are in the south midwest and the states with the best school systems are in the higher tax northeast north midwest .

oh cool , this is my favorite question ! so here 's the deal there are a very wide range of libertarian subleanings of sorts . let 's ignore all of that for the time present . in my personal view , there are a few principle adherences that make someone a libertarian . '' here we go , making this as eli5 as possible . first and foremost , a libertarian is an individualist . we believe that you have the right to your life , your liberty , and your property . the three major guiding philosophies behind this are the nonaggression principle nap , the concept of voluntaryism , and the concept of the homestead principle . below are a few short definitions . i 'm not going to go into the logical pathways used to arrive at the conclusions , but instead just expose you to what they represent . nap aggression is inherently wrong when used to initiate offensive force on an individualgroup . the differentiating facet that makes this different than pacifism is that you are most certainly allowed to defend yourself . some even make the argument that you are morally required to defend yourself , but that 's a topic for a different discussion . voluntaryism this is the idea that all human interaction should be voluntary that is , you should n't be forced into any association in any capacity . whether it 's who you choose to be around or who you choose to do business with , the only person who should be allowed to make those decisions is you . this has social and economic applications . voluntaryism also drives the basis of our economic outlook in that exchange of property of any sort should only take place if both parties agree to do so . no one can coerce you into a transaction . as a side note , this is one of the biggest reasons why individuals on the far left often falsely characterize libertarians as being similar to altright individuals . technically , under voluntaryism , discrimination is not a crime . it 's a dick move , but not a crime . if you choose not to sell that cake to that gay couple because you do n't want to , that 's reason enough . we believe the market will punish you sufficiently , or in other words , you are exchanging potential market share for the ability to conduct business in the manner of your choosing . if you elect not to engage with others of a different race , hey , i do n't get why , but that 's your prerogative pal . i ca n't make anyone do anything they do n't want to do . the homestead principle so you may be wondering to yourself , self , rux has addressed property and voluntary exchange and all , but how did property ever become property to begin with ? '' the homestead principle outlines this issue . basically , to summarize in a very simple way , combining your individual productivity with an unowned entity can make it your property . they call it performing an appropriating '' activity . older texts have referenced this idea by saying homesteading is an act of mixing your labor with the land , '' making it yours . take note of this issue with the two party paradigm in the us one party favors economic liberties while seemingly being ok with restricting social ones and the other party favors social liberties , but does n't mind using the state 's monopoly on the legitimate use of force to coerce money from the people and spend it in ways of their choosing . when i ask people whether they 'd rather have economic or social liberties , most people ask why ca n't i have both ? '' this statement outlines perfectly the way libertarians view rights . you have the right to life , liberty , and property . applications in our society transcend placing them in an economic or social grouping , as so many have applications in both . we do n't view rights as being part of one of those two groups . rights are just that , rights ! i could really go on and on about this , but this basic outline is the making of someone who i would describe as libertarian . ''	eb5viu2	Libertarian
markets do not determine fair value , markets determine the maximum price a consumer will pay . aka the fair value . if it wasn t fair , the consumer wouldn t pay it . market led transactions have overhead of money that the consumer could spend elsewhere if a fair value was set for a good or service . and what entity should that be ?	e1ebf2m	Libertarian

sorry i didn t know it makes you a conspiracy theorist to take note of the obvious fact that one of hillary clinton s friends ran on a third party ticket then said don t vote for me , vote for hillary well you seem to be saying that he ran on the third party ticket with the intention of sabotaging it from the beginning . we have absolutely no evidence to suggest that and the implication is that he was conspiring with the clintons , so by definition that 's a conspiracy theory . you are so fucking dense it is remarkable . and you are an utter piece of shit for blaming gary johnson who has done nearly as much for libertarianism as anyone , instead of the guy who literally stabbed the party in the back . i 'm aware of everything gary johnson has done for libertarianism and i 'm not throwing him under the bus , but it 's definitely a fair criticism that his campaign was lacking whether it was due to lack of resources or simply johnson dropping the ball . all the good that johnson has done in the past does not make him immune to criticism and anybody who wants libertarianism to continue to succeed should agree with that . in fact , one of the biggest problems with the party imo is that the competition just is n't there for the nomination . your argument is seriously yeah well he endorsed his opponent and sabotaged the ticket but what difference at this point does it make no , my argument is that if we 're going to pick something to be mad at it should n't be at the outsider who the lp let run on our ticket . he never should have been on the ticket in the first place and that 's on johnson and the rest of the party leadership . the party already has a reputation as republicanlite '' so maybe we should take a look at ourselves and recognize the problem for what it was . it s remarkable how much democratsympathizing scum has come into the libertarian umbrella . oh well . all libertarians with over 2 brain cells are now supporting trump after they realized the democrats obviously coopted the libertarian party . i ll leave this dumpster fire to morons like you who have to go through extensive mental gymnastics every day to apologize for someone who literally betrayed the party . i do n't support trump because he simply does n't stand for anything close to libertarianism . he 's a protectionist with a weird fetish for border walls and authoritarianism . that 's not somebody who any libertarian should be able to rationalize getting behind , but here we are having this conversation because he ran on the gop ticket . all that being said , much like when i find myself all too often defending trump 's right to say outlandish things , as a libertarian i do believe in your right to be an asshole so by all means call me democratsympathizing scum '' and question the number of my brain cells . i think most people here see right through your attempt to gaslight me into supporting someone who is so far removed from libertarianism that he 's too busy trying to build a wall to keep people out from a country that may have a libertarian president soon .	dyyynb5	Libertarian

your first link 's responses are comically baseless which is probably why they 're only published on a blog . owing to the constantly increasing concentration of leaseholds , ireland constantly sends her own surplus to the english labor market , and thus forces down wages and lowers the material and moral position of the english working class . this is what illegal immigrants are doing to unskilled labor in the us . unions are not the answer because they lower the amount of workers in order to give more benefits and higher wages to those in their union . this does not benefit the maximum amount of workers and it 's ridiculous to assume unions will capture the entire labor market .	eaqsn7u	Libertarian

this is blatantly false , even the bell curve , the book that you guys pretend confirms all of the things you believed even before you did what passes for research in your circles , explains the difference through poverty and traditionally low education both of which have noncontroversial causative links to lower iqs . it is a demonstrable fact that , on average because , for example , regardless of your opinion on the man barack obama and his family are quite obviously smarter than the vast majority of people regardless of race , black people in the united states have marginally lower iq outcomes than other measured groups , but it has never , not a single time , been demonstrated that this is a result of genetics . here 's a couple of fun facts poverty causes lower iq , and no this is not swapping a cause and effect poor people eat worse bad food equals a bad body and brain , have lower access to education iq is learned as well as genetic , crystallized and fluid intelligence respectively , and are more likely to fall into drug abuse we all know what that does to your brain . black people possess 5 for every 100 that a white person has , it should be easy for you to see the implication there . there 's also a pretty hefty amount of evidence that education has multigenerational effects on iq so if you go to college , you kids will be smarter regardless of whether they also go to college , and in fact every several years iq tests have to be adjusted so that the average score remains 100 , because there is a significant rise over time and people who have been left out of education have been left out of this as well , so black people who have been left out of good quality education for generations even in the modern world have been left out of this generational increase . though then again , your username is literally science is n't consensus '' , yet you 're trying to argue from a fabricated scientific consensus , so maybe i should n't expect too much from you .	e356dw1	Libertarian

logically speaking , the more weapons there are in a society percapita , the greater your risk of being shot . this does not follow logically at all , and indeed is not borne out by the data . logically speaking the more shootings you have in a society percapita , the greater your risk of being shot , the number of guns in existence is irrelevant . the data backs this up , with wide divergences in the homicide rate and firearm ownership rate , both within the us and when you compare the us to the rest of the world .	dwsyu55	Libertarian

religion a beliefset one follows devotedly that defines their ethics and morals that often but does n't have to entail worshipping some sort of deity . the deity can be many different things , including oneself or material objects . for instance , i am messianic . i follow the biblical scriptures which is where i derive what is moral and ethical and i worship the biblical god outlined therein whom is the benevolent creator having all authority . tell me , do statists believe they are acting ethically and morally in their desire to concentrate economic and political power in the state for society 's best interest ? most of the time their reasoning boils down to the state will care for you '' . the state is the source of authority in life for the statist . the state is the deity and taxes are their tithes . of course i 'm just being pedantic and statist do n't actually believe this themselves .	e4dum29	Libertarian

are you joking ? providing services that other businesses do n't is what pushes businesses to the forefront and makes them massively successful . what businesses still exist that have n't changed with the times to provide services that accommodate modern needs ? sears is down in the gutter because it did n't transition as it should have to online shopping like amazon provides . providing something useful to people that other businesses couldn'tdid n't want to i.e . baking a cake for a gay couple is what makes or breaks a business . i 'm interested in these numbers you 're looking at to come to your conclusion . the point of the business is n't even necessarily to do better or damage the other business , just to provide the service to the people that could n't use the other one , which the business made to serve the discriminated should stay afloat if they manage correctly also , on the topic of voting with your dollar , there was a post on the front page earlier of a cereal brand whose large box of cereal actually contained less cereal than the small box . do you really think a post like that getting huge on a social media site is going to go unnoticed by consumers , let alone the business itself ? yes , but these are for brand name products to be mass producedpurchased in a store . what bakeries do you go to that has these for their products ? how would we apply these systems to a car dealership that did n't want to sell a car to a person that is blank ? how would we apply these systems to a landscaping service that does work on one 's yardhome ? you misinterpret what i meant with that statement . the slippery slope is the government having precedent to be able to tell businesses what they can or ca n't believe . a business owner not wanting to sell a product to someone based off of a superficial difference is a whole lot different than them not wanting to inform consumers of what their product contains . one is a social issue , which are never black and white as you can see by the discussion going on here for this particular one , and the other is an issue of safety which , making the citizens feel safe is what the government should be doing .	e06jt3j	Libertarian

while it s probably not the most common usage pattern , heroin and other opioids can be used responsibly . it s all about dosage , and analogous to someone drinking a couple beers vs. a handle of vodka . however , that doesn t apply when the heroin you buy off the street is not pure or accurately dosed , containing unknown amounts of fent . i m not advocating for heroin usage , but people will use it regardless of legality and the safest way to use it is without question to make clean , pure heroin available . drug addiction is about the person , not the substance . if you could find someway to take away their heroin history has proven this impossible anyway , they would simply move on to some other drug or selfdestructive behavior . the best possible outcome can be achieved by making both clean drugs and good treatment options regularly available .	eauldcn	Libertarian

even if everything you just said is true and murders are 5x more prevalent in the us , 5 per 100,000 is still an extremely low number and i ll take that over having to live in a country where i can t own a gun , cant defend myself against tyrannical government and now can t even fucking own a knife . who the fuck knows where that is going to stop ? it doesn t take a historical genius to know that you guys are heading down a very dark path . gun control URL had almost no impact on murder rate in the u.k. , so it s a lot more likely that these differences are attributable to culture more than anything . the us has a much more diverse population and certain small groups of americans are responsible for at least 50 of homicides . you linked a 166 page document , i don t have time to read all of that . it is probably true that murder happens more frequently in the us than it does in the uk . i would also imagine the dprk doesn t have a very high incidence of homicide . the point is that i live in a mostly free nation and if my government did start imposing tyrannical policies i would have the power to at least fight against that . can you say the same ? you re literally defending a satirical post about knife control bro that s some serious statism worship	dxf8b4d	Libertarian

you were claiming laws that bar discrimination are immoral , but i suppose we 'll table that . i think this latest argument holds far more water than claiming either discrimination is not immoral or that laws restricting discrimination are inherently immoral . at this point it is just down to whether you value the right to discriminate more than curbing discrimination . i certainly do n't . and while i ca n't see how you could arrive there i can at least see some benefit even if it seems vastly out of proportion to the detrimental effects of not having the government regulate discrimination .	ds1xr37	Libertarian

if you do n't like facebook , you can easily choose any other website . same for google and youtube . they may not have the same content , but that 's besides the point . until paypal and stripe cut you off from the financial system or google seizes your domain name , both of which have actually happened . the situation is a lot more dire than you think . if you hate your isp , you may not have an alternative , or have no good alternative . time has shown again and again that companies will rather merge and maximize profits than compete and deliver the best services , which is only logical when the objective is to maximize profits , so the physical barriers of setting up an alternative matter a lot , leading to a huge part of the population never having access to a good isp . i have multiple isps where i live . if i did n't , i could always move . compare that to being banned from a google , facebook , or a twitter there 's literally nowhere i can move where gab or bitchute will be more popular than what they 're competing against . isps are only regional monopolies at best , while silicion valley is global . so , if anything , i would argue that the situation is even worse . if alex jones was n't alex jones , then being faced with a purge on that scale would have been the end of his career , full stop , and that 's the reality for many smaller content creators who are already struggling to make a living as it is . it 's legitimately revolting to me that cnn and the times whine about journalists feeling unsafe and donald trump 's attacks on freedom of the press when they 're actually the ones who are actively trying to squeeze out their competitors . there 's also the fact that isp censorship simply does not exist , unlike the censorship you 're defending . as far as i can tell nn was just about preventing isps from beiny able to charge silicon valley more money for the same amount of bandwidth , which shields them from the effects of the free market and actually makes censorship smell like something that rises to the level of a first amendment violation .	e3vnjqt	Libertarian

mollie orshansky , the government economist working at the social security administration who developed the thresholds , based the threshold levels on the cost of purchasing what in the mid1950s had been determined by the us department of agriculture to be the minimal nutritionallyadequate amount of food necessary to feed a family . orshansky multiplied the cost of the food basket by a factor of three , under the assumption that the average family spent one third of its income on food . while the poverty threshold is updated for inflation every year , the basket of food used to determine what constitutes being deprived of a socially acceptable minimum standard of living has not been updated since 1955. as a result , the current poverty line only takes into account food purchases that were common more than 50 years ago , updating their cost using the consumer price index . when methods similar to orshansky 's were used to update the food basket using prices for the year 2000 instead of from nearly a half century earlier , it was found that the poverty line should actually be 200 higher than the official level being used by the government in that year . yet even that higher level could still be considered flawed , as it would be based almost entirely on food costs and on the assumption that families still spend a third of their income on food . in fact , americans typically spent less than one tenth of their aftertax income on food in 2000. some 12 million americans live with diseases associated with extreme poverty . according to philip alston , the united nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights , 19 million people live in deep poverty a total family income that is below onehalf of the poverty threshold in the united states as of 2017 .	dyrf7t7	Libertarian

it 's not the people in power this cartoonist is mentioning , it is the people who blindly trust anyone who claims rape . though it seems some people in power already hate kavanaugh and just needed a reason to forbid him from entering the scotus , most of them are willing to make it impartial . seems like a straw man . this is a land of free speech , and people can form their own opinions . they may find her testimony compelling and credible and others malicious and deceitful . who 's to say they would trust anyone who claims rape ? i work with children and we 're trained to treat all allegations of abuse as if they 're true you absolutely make it clear to the child you believe them , and they are meant to be treated with dignity throughout the very difficult process . look what happens when that process fails as has happened at penn state and the catholic church . that is entirely separate from criminal procedures , where there must obviously be a high standard of proof for conviction . but if people do want to forbid him form entering the scotus based on what 's happened , why should n't they ? justices of the supreme court have a constitutional requirement to be of good behaviour . the test for being a supreme court justice is obviously going to be far more stringent than the test for being incarcerated or executed ! there 's been a lot that has come out in the last week which might bring into question kavanaugh 's behaviour and disposition .	e6uvkc3	Libertarian

i 'm against anything that terminates a human 's existence both abortion and death penalty . it 's no man 's privilege to decide another human is unfit to live . it is certainly not a right . it 's good to be against anything that terminates human existence . but whether abortion does that is dependent on when human existence begins . this is the central issue . life does not come from that which is not already living , so at every point during pregnancy , the fetus is alive in the biological sense . i suppose . but that does n't mean it 's human and goes back to the when does human existence begin question . the fetus , if left to natural events , will become what everyone agrees is a human person unless there 's a miscarriage or some complication at birth . i assume your stance does have exceptions for life of the mother and rape and incest ? the upshot of these bullet points is that since the fetus is both alive and is human , it has rights . government does not have the authority to make decisions about life rights . that is only if you are right , which is the question of when human existence begins . counterargument to its the woman 's body '' it 's not really the woman 's body . after conception there is another , genetically distinct human involved . in nearly half of all pregnancies , the fetus is not even the same sex as the mother this to me indicates one can not make a claim that it is solely the woman 's body that 's involved . counterargument to its the woman 's choice '' before conception , the choice is whether or not to engage in an act that can lead to conception a choice well within the rights of any human . after conception , the choice is no longer whether to conceive , but rather whether or not to terminate a life since the fetus is both alive and human . as such , all rights concerning life must be involved . i hope this means you are for better sex ed and access to birth control . poor people are the majority of the patients that have abortions . perhaps buying condoms or getting on birth control would break the bank . to say that they just should n't have sex then is petty . we all love sex and wish we could have more of it . pregnancy as a condition is not lethal the prognosis of pregnancy is not death and thus lethal force can not be justified . it 's not certain death , but it can be life threatening in certain circumstances , which is why almost anyone who is against abortions give exceptions to life of the mother . counter argument to but the fetus is just a bunch of cells , it 's no different than killing any other cells '' the mother , only has the authority to kill her own cells , since they are her bodyproperty . the fetus is not her own cells , so she does n't have the authority to kill them any more than she would have the authority to kill a group of cells in any other human being . where are those cells coming from ? they 're coming from the mother . her own body is making these cells . counterargument to fetuses do n't have rights '' it 's a very dangerous thing to claim that a human does not have rights simply because of its stage in the life cycle or it 's ability to survive on its own . there are full grown humans who can not survive on their own , and no one objects to their basic rights as humans . rights are not timedependent no ephemeral stage in human development should be without basic rights afforded to all humans at any point in life . this of course is dependent on when human existence begins which is the center of the debate . i also think that maybe it 's the slippery slope logical fallacy that if we say unborn babies do n't have rights , it 's a slippery slope that leads to born babies not having rights , etc . '' counter argument to the fetus is violating the nonaggression principle since it is a parasite on the mother '' the fetus can not be a parasite in the biological sense . in the biological sense , the fetus is an offspring . if the intended meaning of the word parasite '' or similar words is one who drains resources from another '' , then there are plenty of adults , children , elderly folks who would all fall into this category and they are granted the right to life without question . further , the fetus is in its location through actions of the parents the fetus never made an active choice to set up shop in the mother 's body , it was placed there by its parents . we disagree on the idea of a parasite . old people and children and whatnot may figurstivrly be parasites , but what people are getting at when they call a fetus a parasite is that it is relying solely on the mother . once they give birth , it is no longer a parasite in the sense that they are not reliant on a single person . they can be kept alive by anyone . counter argument to the government simply chooses the definition of when life starts '' this is not a definition the government gets to make . there is no power to do such outlined in the constitution and in fact , the constitution says the right to life is endowed by our creator '' that is to say , the authority of life rights are outside the jurisdiction of governmental oversight . the authority of life rights are outside the jurisdiction of governmental oversight . so we go back to when human existence begins , which there is massive debate over . counter argument to no one has a positive right over others . the mother has no obligation to care for the fetus or provide it with nutritients from her body . i mean ... unless she starves herself , she also does n't have a choice about providing the fetus with nutrients . after childbirth the parents are required by law to care for the baby it 's no different during pregnancy . a mother can not stop feeding her newborn and use the argument 'the baby has no right to demand i feed it . they ca n't not care for a fetus . its inside her . we ca n't control where nutrients in our body go . tl dr there is no right which gives any person the authoritychoice to terminate the existence of another human a fetus is a human and thus has a right to life . there is no concrete determination of when human existence begins . personally , i do n't believe it is at conception . it 's fine for you to believe it is . the way i see it , abortions will happen whether it is legal or not , and having legal abortions means that they will be safer . every individual can determine how they feel about abortions and determine whether it is ok to have one . banning abortions because you do n't agree is not libertarian . i 'm not saying that this is what you think and i would n't have even replied to this comment except that when i read it it seemed like you were saying all of it as fact and not your personal opinion . and i apologize if it seems like i 'm doing the same thing .	dzqu1yk	Libertarian

what is a global elite '' exactly ? anyone successful in international business ? if jobs are being lost where ? why does u.s. employment continue to climb ? you expected these tariffs to be announced and immediately the next day 179k people get pink slips ? this is only the projected impact from our own new steel and aluminum tariff taxes , not even taking into account retaliatory tariffs and other measures our trade partners will take . propaganda is sometimes difficult to sift through . this one is easy . instead of rushing to reject offhand any data that seems negative to your current world view , please try to consider rationally what happens when cost of intermediate inputs for us manufacturers rises by 25 . do you genuinely believe these manufacturers importing foreign steel will feel the squeeze and not shed any jobs ? how about the auto and aviation manufacturers who use machinery , parts and fabricated steel from the other manufacturers ? construction costs rise , prices rise and demand slows . does it not make sense that all the service businesses who rely on these companies as customers will also suffer negative impact ? again this is one small industry with limited relevance to our overall economy the more new tariff taxes are added , and the more our trade partners retaliate , we will see similar negative impacts will occur across many different industries and at a certain point consumer prices rise enough that buying power real wages decline .	e3ps5q5	Libertarian

libertarianism in a sentence is wanting individual freedom over collective compromise . that comes with all the warts and flaws that leftist want to eliminate through collective compromise . like paying taxes to pay for social programs . the big driving force of libertarianism is being against the use of force to make people do things against their will . that 's why they say taxation is theft . if people wanted to contribute to social programs they would n't need to be forced to do it . would n't that simply accumulate resources in the hands of a few people ? why would they not use them to force their way around ? and if these few people hold all the resources how would you ensure that coersion does n't pop up since they can simply say do as i say or no food for you tonight '' . is this not a power structure that compromises the principle of no forcing people to do stuff '' . i mean this is the whole idea behind social programmes in the first place . the praise of the free market is praising individual exchanges of goods without someone compelling something from someone . agains , the market creates inequality of wealth , inequality of wealth creates inequality of power , inequality of power means people start forcing others around . how do you ensure this does n't happen ? trump is being blasted for wanting a wall between us and mexico . meanwhile italy 's pm wants to close airports to prevent migrants from entering and has popular support . not saying you 're italian but i think politics are fairly different in other countries . i also do n't think anyone has anything similar to our racial issues . racism exists other places but black people in the us are defined by their relationship with white people . i do n't think anything is similar anywhere else in the world . politics are essentially the various ways power is distributed within the society . the moral principles that guide the distribution are what matters not the issues the society faces at a specific moment . for me the two examples you gave are essentially the same moral principles applied in different situations natinalism , exclusivity of access to an area , racism maybe . i think the racial issues are generally common for most american countries , argentina and brazil seem to have similar histories on racial discrimination but i do n't know enough about this . i think you 'll be surprised . right wing populism is on the rise everywhere and i fear the weak boxing match between the dems and gop where the gop always loses has got a lot of right wingers pissed off . they will adopt ideas that are dumb and possibly even evil just to spite people on the left . i mean 4chan seems to pride itself on coming up with something innocent and tricking the media into making it a racist symbol . i think right wing ideas are on a dramatic uptick and have pulled many of the people who were pushing for ron paul in 2012. yes they will , but the more ridiculous they get the more people they will alienate , the democratic party had been in shamples for some time now but it will probably get its shit together or become irrelevant . i have a bunch of people all arguing and saying i 'm stupid and dumb . debates do n't have a bunch of name calling . i do n't call people names in hopes of hearing their views . it 's usually the exact opposite . i want them to shut up so i pull away from the topic at hand to insult them into stopping . i am personally sorry if i called you names , i acted having in mind stereotypes rather than positions . tribalism can get me too i guess .	eypdmpx	Libertarian

if the jobs cost more than they yield , then i do n't see why . i thought we are against socialism and picking winners and losers . what ? i 'm confused what you mean here . not saying states should bend over to get companies to come there by cost analysis i mean they looked at their cost of operation in ny , looked at what the state offered and said ehhh ... the primary issue here is n't the state did n't offer enough , is that they take too much . they made their state oppressive enough for business they have to try lure in companies like amazon by promising large breaks and exemptions from their shitty systems . for the same reasoning the state would n't offer more than they get if the jobs cost more than they yield , then i do n't see why . amazon will look at what they get . ny is expensive , and the state could n't offer enough to make it more appealing than other states . so those states will get the jobs . ks and mo have been fighting over companies for years , offering more and more tax cuts . as a result , the states are pulling in millions less , and there have been no job growths . basically the same company just keeps changing which side of the river they are on , and get at tax cut . yeah there 's a great planet money podcast on this . solidifies the point that companies will abuse exemptions '' compared to just having a good place to do business with out needing wooing . do you really believe there are no companies that want that space in in ny ? i 'm sure some do , depending on opex and capex of what they want to do , ny may be not the best option . my point is forprofit companies that are profitable evaluate the worth of these decisions . i do n't believe states should be trying to lure business through exemptions , they should create job friendly policy that is the same for everyone . effectively they could not offer enough exemptions from their oppressive policies to get amazon to come . so they did a cost evaluation and said ehh , we can do better elsewhere .	eghwesk	Libertarian

americans only have two concerns outside their own families food security , and energy security . here in factually the greatest land on earth , north america , with the greatest food and energy productivity of any nation in history , going all the way back to the pharoahs , there are americans still going to bed hungry and malnourished , and americans who must choose between buying medicine or buying gasoline to get to work . a true progressive knows that the only two populist issues are food security and energy security . yet not a single selfdescribed populist has proposed ebt for all , a supplemental food allowance debit card for every american , here in the richest food exporting country on earth . sanders has never proposed ebt4a , warren has never proposed ebt4a , aoc and her brigade ... not one presidential candidate has proposed ebt4a , even though it 's already fully subsidized to the big seven agricultural monopolies . a true progressive also knows that egregious new energy taxes on gasoline and utilities will hurt the poorest americans first . people will start to die from these taxes . they must choose between feeding their children , or heating their homes in winter . seniors on fixed income must chose between food , or ac in summer . and we see so many seniors dying this way , in america the greatest energy producer the world has ever seen ! where is the populism ? ! trump says he 's a populist . sanders says , no , he 's the populist . warren says , no , she is the populist . they 're all pandering to you . not one of the dnc 16 selftitled 'populists ' has proposed energy for all . not one ! in fact , they all propose extreme gasoline and utilities tax hikes ! ! they want to gnd americans for another 1,000 billion a year out of our last life savings to cut our energy access in half , so the deep state can impose impossibly egregiously high 'carbon ' sic taxes on our gasoline and utilities . that 's not populism , that 's fascism . that 's herding poor people into hot boxcars , then turning off their ac . that 's a buchenwald final solution . so when the now 4,875 billion a year bleedout redblue uniparty comes to you in 2020 and says , vote for usa populism ! vote for another 1,000 billion in energystarvation and foodrationing !

first of all , please note that the lp represents only one aspect of libertarianism ask any ancap or ancom . i 'll agree with you that there has been a lot of misinformation put out by both sides . funding sources and perspective bias have corrupted any real chance of impartial data sets . however , we can measure the average amount of co2 in the atmosphere , and we know that it 's a greenhouse gas look at venus for proof . no one in their right mind can deny that pollution is happening and that it 's harmful to the biosphere . the big questions are how much impact are we having , and what can we do about it . the first one may never be answered for the reasons i 've already mentioned , so we should probably lean on the side of caution , with a heavy dose of realism . every single plan i 've seen is either impractical reducing consumption or pushes a political agenda mostly goverment control . the only option i 've seen that 's realistic is increasing our nuclear power production , but that faces political hurdles due to environmentalists . '' my preferred solution was one introduced a while back , but it turned out to be a scam . a company offered to plant trees that would when fully grown reduce an amount of co2 yearly . by paying for these carbon credits , '' companies could voluntarily reduce their longterm footprint . it would look good to the public , and since it would be considered charity , the tax write off made it somewhat economical . sadly , this company '' just took the money , never planting anything afaik . this idea then sadly became the carbon tax favored by government types .	f2b4d7b	Libertarian

what a bunch of lost cause confederate apologia . almost immediately after the end of the civil war , even before reconstruction ended , there was an intensive and organized movement by southern political and social elites to reframe the narrative of the civil war . outright armageddon fellow countrymen inflicted on the south so here you have mass suffering , legit death , sickness , and devastated civilization think baghdad circa 2004 , except the invaders burned your food supplies too with one prominent exception , the american civil war did not involve intentional widespread damage to civilian infrastructure . the total number of civilians killed during the civil war is estimated to be around 50,000 by james mcpherson , which is a very low number in a war that killed around 600,000 soldiers . what this also shows that while there was a food shortage , there was no famine that resulted in high civilian deaths . this was very much helped by food aid sent both by the federal government as well as northern charitable groups . the exception of course , is the actions of william tecumseh sherman , however , his campaign of intentional destruction occurred in a limited geographical area georgia and south carolina . in north carolina , sherman 's campaign was considerably more restrained , as sherman issued orders to spare north carolina for being the last state to secede , and his troops having had their fill of destruction after sherman gave orders to be more through in south carolina as punishment for being the first state to secede . it would be harder to explain how sherman 's actions in two states had an impact on the 11 other southern states he did n't fight through . you were n't taught to hate black people or the north from childhood i find this part hard to believe , as hatred for african americans is taught from childhood from things as simple as frequent use of nigger '' , or the use of terms such as the war of northern aggression '' . one key motivation for the poor white '' southerner to fight to maintain the institution of slavery was summarized by lyndon b johnson 100 years after the fact . if you can convince the lowest white man he s better than the best colored man , he won t notice you re picking his pocket . hell , give him somebody to look down on , and he ll empty his pockets for you . slavery and later jim crow created a system where what lbj said was the truth . although poor whites of the south were not in a good position , at the very least they viewed it as better than any slave . abolishing slavery would erase the legal advantage that separated poor whites had over blacks . the effects to the nonslaveholder . accompanied as that measure is to be , by reducing the two races to an equalityor , in other words , in elevating the negro slave to an equality with the white manit will be to the nonslaveholder , equally with the largest slaveholder , the obliteration of caste and the deprivation of important privileges . the color of the white man is now , in the south , a title of nobility in his relations as to the negro and although cuffy or sambo may be immensely his superior in wealth , may have his thousands deposited in bank , as some of them have , and may be the owner of many slaves , as some of them are , yet the poorest nonslaveholder , being a white man , is his superior in the eye of the law may serve and command in the militia may sit upon juries , to decide upon the rights of the wealthiest in the land may give his testimony in court , and may cast his vote , equally with the largest slaveholder , in the choice of his rulers . in no country in the world doesthe poor white man , whether slaveholder or nonslaveholder , occupy so enviable a position as in the slaveholding states of the south . his color here admits him to social and civil privileges , which the white man enjoys nowhere else . in countries where negro slavery does not exist , as in the northern states of this union and in europe , the most menial and degrading employments in society are filled by the white poor , who are hourly seen drudging in them . poverty , then , in those countries , becomes the badge of inferiority , and wealth , or distinction . hence the arrogant airs which wealth there puts on , in its intercourse with the poor man . but in the southern slaveholding states , where these menial and degrading offices are turned over to be per formed exclusively by the negro slave , the status and color of the black race becomes the badge of inferiority , and the poorest nonslaveholder may rejoice with the richest of his brethren of the white race , in the distinction of his color . the poorest nonslaveholder , too , except as i have before said , he be debased by his vices or his crimes , thinks and feels and acts as if he was , and always intended to be , superior to the negro . he may be poor , it is true but there is no point upon which he is so justly proud and sensitive as his privilege of caste and there is nothing which he would resent with more fierce indignation than the attempt of the abolitionist to emancipate the slaves and elevate the negros to an equality with himself and his family . south carolina state senator john townsend URL	efk6hq1	Libertarian
2.6 is entirely antiunion . your opinion noted . in general , libertarians take a dim view of the government forcing people to do things . as i mentioned before , we believe that if a union is actually desirable , it will prosper on its own merits , free of government force . why would you even pretend to be in favor of unions when they go against everything you believe in ? i ca n't speak for other libertarians , but , as i said before , i am ambivalent about unions . if a group of employees think they will be better off by forming a union , then they should do so , and i have no objections . i see myself as neither prounion '' nor antiunion '' . i just do n't care much either way .	f1ay35e	Libertarian

i think the libertarian party would need to unify before they could ever even consider a populist movement . we have no real message , beside taxation is theft . that s so vague and the issues are more complex i think we need to figure out what we actually stand for rather than spout catchy maxims . we need to start a movement that actually can win something .	edrx0oy	Libertarian

who says there 's going to be little crime ? also , i mentioned freeriding because outside of nap violations , there are people in society that do not encourage the wellbeing of the community . in basic community selfdefense , there 's no incentive to address these kinds of people . especially in a cosmopolitan city ... of course a homicidal person will easily be addressed by the community , but the community really has no incentive to crack down on every criminal . in a moderately sized libertarian town , not everyone will trust each other , and some may not see a need to look out for their community . the only form of security these people will trust is a security firm , because their community shares different beliefs , cultural norms , and traditions that disagree with them .	eez5nhz	Libertarian
i meant decades within each respective timeline and it may be improving , but to what extent ? the police are always corrupt , there is always crime and poverty s , it seems as though gotham is always falling apart at the seams . sure , wayne can build a monorail or whatever and its great that he s employing people , but there are deeper , systemic problems that he rarely ever addresses which would help gotham much more than just fighting individual bad guys . obviously a lot of the possible solutions wouldn t be ideal for comic book , but pretending like charity is the end all be all is kinda silly .	eg25w9n	Libertarian
i like the idea but one problem is that once we have ubi , some people are still gon na need extra help , and were still not gon na let them starve in the street . so it really depends on what your goal is . if you want people to not starve or be sick or homeless then its probably better to just give them those things instead of cash .	fbvcxr9	Libertarian

you are using framing on this argument so hard i think you might have even duped yourself . nobody is implying that mass panic and riots would be caused by people keeping their own money . that is a ridiculous position that nobody is making , so to frame your argument as such makes it seem as though the only people who could possibly disagree with you are utter morons . the argument is simple . many people are very bad at long term planning . they will inevitably run in issues . without support from wider society , they wont just curl up and starve to death with the understanding that they brought this on themselves . they will blame others and lash out . civil unrest and revolution are the societal norm . just look around the world . it could easily happen here . unless you throw these people a bone , they will cause everyone problems . if you live in the middle of nowhere and just dont care about society at all , do n't be surprised when wider society doesnt care about your opinions either .	f18l9l8	Libertarian

that s a completely different topic and an entirely different issue . when we talk about climate change we re talking about greenhouse gasses . not cfcs , which were the cause of the ozone depletion event . that has absolutely nothing to do with the mass extinction event , it s a human health issue from increased uvb . i understand the confusion why you might see this as related to climate change , but the mode of action for cfcs and co2ch4 gasses are totally different and unrelated . and in fact the polar ozone story is a great example of how regulation and action helped fix an environmental problem that humans were directly responsible for . yes , i ve explained this . climate has changed on its own . principally through events that caused changes in greenhouse gas levels . the principal event causing a change in greenhouse gas levels right now is human activity through fossil fuel emissions . and it should be further noted that the danger is in the rapid increase of greenhouse gases . eocene and cretaceous periods had increased co2 but the rate at which it rose was magnitudes less than the rate of increase we see now , or saw in relation to the permian extinction event .	eh0bjfi	Libertarian
