but arent these the very same free market anarchists who have got us into the financial mess we are in now ? no . at no time were these people willing to forego all government regulation ... they simply wanted the restrictive regulations removed . those regulations that allowed them to exist in the first place they 'd have spent millions lobbying to protect , in fact , they more or less do that constantly . it 's funny that libertarians can be blamed for this mess without us even so much as ever having a single libertarian elected or appointed . i also find the whole basis of capitalism slightly dubious . how can you have constant expansion of profitssales etc when we live on a planet with finite resources ? only corporations insist on growth . capitalism only requires that you make a profit ... zero growth is perfectly acceptable . the farmer plowing 100 acres and selling the products of his labor for more than it costs him to do it , that 's capitalism . he need not buy an extra 10 acres every year , expanding his empire . if you want to be rid of the expansionism , you need not kill capitalism ... that farmer with 100 acres making a profit is n't a problem . why interfere with him ?	c05wfs6	Libertarian
there 's another side of it , which is that patents increase the cost of doing research and producing new products . the situation is especially bad in pharmaceuticals , because many new drugs infringe on dozens of existing patents . and every one of the patent owners thinks their patents are the critical ones and demands big money for them . that 's one major reason why big pharm keeps releasing retreads of their existing product lines , and not so much new stuff . one company abandoned a very promising alzheimers drug because they would 've had to negotiate with 30 patent holders , and did n't expect they 'd see any profit by the time they were done . source a new book called the gridlock economy .	c04xhbx	Libertarian

in a capitalistic system , the government still holds the right to engage in programs that can benefit the whole populace when the program is not profitable . now , education is more a local benefit than a generic federal one , so i would think that education should be left to the state governments or private groups if you so choose to do so , but you can not expect everyone to be able to afford private schooling , and for the most part they arewere . now if only we could get nclb axed . i would n't say only poor people go to public schools . my family is n't poor , and we went to a public school . now , there are only two private schools in our region and they 're probably worse than the public school i went to , and my father believes in supporting the community which also includes supporting the school district , but you are still wrong .	c06amvp	Libertarian

i do n't exactly like social security either , but there are many , many people out there who need it to survive . the only alternative i can think of would be for people to support their elder relatives . but really , how many redditers would want their grandmother moving in with them ? i 'm sure a few would , but the vast majority would not . hopefully though , after this generation has been long gone social security will be used only for the disabled instead of them and the elderly . we must remember that not too long ago not many jobs offered retirement plansbenefits the way they do today .	c04oknf	Libertarian

hi stalktard . so tell me , are you illiterate or just lazy ? actually , it seems like a bit of both . first off , you assuming i made some kind of ludicrously offensive statement '' without actually reading the conversation , makes you an ignorant douchebag once again . but hey , emotional kneejerk outbursts in reaction to things you are completely uninformed about is kind of your thing , huh ? it 's a fact like you care that stalin and mao each killed several times more people than hitler . if calling someone a less of a genocidal maniac than stalin , the most prolific massmurderer in history , is what you call a positive spin '' , you are out of your tiny fucking mind . at the end of the day though , you can think what you want . seriously . i really do n't give a fuck what you think of me . why ? because i know you 're nothing but some braindead halfwit on the internet who wants so desperately to be offended so you can feed your beloved victimhood mentality , that you actually go out of your way to manufacture things to be offended about . you do this by projecting your own miserable prejudices onto others , thereby alleviating from yourself any responsibility for the miserable existence that is your life . i wonder howif you function in the real world with that level of oversensitivity . with any kind of luck , at some point you 'll stress yourself out so much that you give yourself an aneurysm and the rest of us can get some fucking peace .	2ijy	Libertarian

wars and famines before industrialization ? yes there were some , iirc . even since industrialization we have n't seen climaterelated wars . no , but we have seen climaterelated refugee movements , and access to water is a huge source of conflict and tension in se asia and the middle east , even if we have n't seen outright wars for various reasons . warming of the climate worries me far less than cooling . it 's one thing if , for example , canada 's plains become north america 's bread basket . it 's quite another if nothing will grow north of texas . the economy is globalised . the usa ca n't sustain current population . let alone lifestyle , without imports , imho . warmer in the past . colder in the past . more co2 in the past . less co2 in the past . all of this before human activity could have been a factor . why is n't this obvious to more people ? just because some houses catch fire by accident does n't make arson impossible ! noone sane is saying that the planet never changes , only that we can and are changing the planet .	c0fsoex	Libertarian

however , i wish you pussies who downvoted me could at least offer some argument . okay . even though ad hominem attacks are very juvenile . i love how when things are great , the free market gets all of the credit . however , when we had 8 years of unprecedented deregulation , and then we get this financial collapse , instead of acknowledging that maybe the free market has some downsides , we get , no , its the government . that 's because we don't have a free market . we have n't had a truly free market since the turn of the 20th century .

my grandparents have lived off social security for over 30 years . and it 's not because they 're deadbeats , who never saved . my grandma was so thrifty that she sewed my mom 's clothes and winter coats because it was cheaper . my grandpa worked in a coal mine . and one day there was an accident . he was hurt , badly , and had brain damage . he was in the hospital for a long time getting better and learning to walk again . my mom , who was in high school , got a job so she could help put food on the table . my grandma could n't work because she had to take care of him . and times were tough . they would have ended up on the streets with a very severally disabled man if it were n't for social security . so when you say that we should phase out a very real safety net i get angry . our family did n't plan on this . they saved as best they could , and before he got hurt , my grandpa held down 3 jobs at once , just to pay the bills and so that they could save a little . sure , the coal company paid for his medical bills they still do to this day , but that does n't cover for things like his lost wages , or pay the mortgage . social security is a needed function to keep old and disabled people off the street and fed . and telling people well , they should have saved more '' just does n't cut it .	c0y3k1x	Libertarian

the amount of work either of us has done is the same in each case but because of this specific skill that does n't benefit anyone else , one of us makes more money . the work you have done is not the same . in your example , if he got the widget you created for 1.50 , it may not seem like it , but he worked harder to get that than you . he probably had already been on many sales calls already , so he was not nervous , while you were . he 'd probably spent money on a sales seminar , or better yet , his boss spent the money on him and put him under contract in exchange for it . maybe had already had a script book that he or his company created one that could be used to answer any objections that the person has in the negotiation process . maybe , after all his time learning , and studying human reactions and psychology , he notices that your arm pits were wet , denoting that you were under stress to get a sale . maybe he noticed that you had no idea where you wanted negotiations to start , so he low balled you and you took it . he put in the work . yes , his job may be to bump his gums , '' but that is a very , very hard skill to have , lest everyone would do it ! the reason that you feel that this skill is not beneficial is because again , you have never owned , nor tried to create a business . sales , cashflow , and negotiation are the lifeblood of company . on a side note , whenever i hear people complaining about a company , i tell them to vote with their wallets . because they do not understand how a business works , and how sales and cash flow are the lifeblood of all companies , most do not believe that they indeed could make a difference .	c0omhna	Libertarian
eventually '' incorporating is n't the idea at all , a great many small businesses incorporate of form llcs right at the outset because of liability concerns . i have a friend starting a small medical practice right now doing precisely that . many small businesses also do n't immediately seek startup capital mine did n't . while the risks are substantial in doing so , they are not perpetual , and certainly not as great as they would be if the founder of the company could become the personal victim of a lawsuit on behalf of the company . as for the unfair legal system , i 'm inclined to agree , but it 's the legal system we 've got , and it 's not responsible to suggest removing the protection that entrepreneurs need on the assumption that the legal end can and will be reformed . liability law reform has been a real soon now '' item on every politicians agenda for 25 years , yet it never seems to get done .	c0r2ark	Libertarian

well not absolutely , its a complex argument that has a very valid side in that when you massively increase the amount of disposable income consumers have a consumer based economy will experience a boost in cash flow . sure some buisness with heavy labor costs will have to raise prices which will have wide reaching effects , but saying that those prices would be exorbitant or universal is untrue . not to mention it 's not like this cost disappears , you pay it everyday in taxes to subsidize the same income with government hand outs . those people just do n't go away , they just drain society in a more complex and abusable way .	cdpf6xh	Libertarian

the right to silence is in the fifth amendment it is the right not to incriminate oneself . silence is not the same as selfincrimination . the right to silence goes beyond the right not to be compelled to selfincriminate the right to silence is prophylactic . the right to defensive counsel is in the sixth amendment . yes , but the 6th amendment right to counsel does n't attach until formal judicial proceedings have been initiated for example , when indicted . the right to counsel prior to formal judicial proceedings being initiated is a prophylactic protection of the right against compelled selfincrimination . miranda held that you have to be informed of these rights for any of your statements to be admissible in court . that is true , but miranda also requires a valid wavier of those rights either express or implied .	c9prwsz	Libertarian

we had two jehovah 's witnesses in our class growing up who refused to stand for the national anthem o ' canada . most kids in the classes ages 611 had no idea why they could n't stand other than something to do with their parents and their religion . what really got me was when one of the kids refused to have a brownie for my birthday . everyone their parents would bring in cookies or brownies for the entire class on their birthday . i felt so bad for this kid when he said he could n't have one because he 'does n't celebrate birthdays ' . i always wondered if this was consistent with jehovah 's witnesses . only time i saw the anthem thing become an issue was when a substitute teacher ripped one of the kids apart in front of the whole class for not standing up.. we did n't see that teacher again after that . the point i 'm trying to make is that it 's clear now that the parents were completely forcing the kids to do this , but as classmates we end up growing this dislike for these kids who do n't know any better .	chjmeap	Libertarian

exactly . if even i , who support libertarian principles , this is proof that you do n't . you 're not even a little libertarian . you see , it 's not as if you 've given hours and days and years of thought to this and come to a different conclusion to me . that 'd be strange , but acceptable . this is the first time you 've thought about it , where you 've spent less than 60 seconds composing a reply to my comment . this means you have n't given it any real thought at all . you 're just reacting . and if you react thoughtlessly to new ideas , if you fail to logic through them , fail to study the implications , if you just kneejerk in favor of your status quo ... then you are no libertarian at all . not even a little . so you go ahead and call it impractical and stupid '' , but you do n't belong here . how could you ever hope to convince people no one ever convinces anyone of anything . that requires thought . but people like yourself do n't really think . you feel , sometimes , or you react . mostly you just support status quos . i have . i 've contemplated it , considered it , no , you have n't . with no indication that you 've ever thought about it before , you simply have n't had time to do so . if you 'd waited 5 months before replying , then it would be plausible . but this ? you 're too stupid to realize how transparent your lie is .	dcaqlho	Libertarian
i did address this the only reason fascismnazism had a smaller deathtoll in the 20th century is that it basically burned itself out before it could become too terribly widespread or longlasting the nazis barely lasted more than a decade , while communism was around for 70ish years in terms of death rate fascism killed people almost twice as fast . and fascism never grew nearly as widespread as communism , so in terms of percentage of the people under their rule that were killed , fascism is still way worse . the only reason communism has a higher death toll is because fascism was stopped way earlier and before it ruled over nearly a third of the earth 's population . not that communism is n't horrible , but it should n't really come as a surprise that the group whose ideology includes the intentional extermination of entire groups of people is more deadly than the group whose ideology is just a completely idiotic economic system .	dlpe8ot	Libertarian
