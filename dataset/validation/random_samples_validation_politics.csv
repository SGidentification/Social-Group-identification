why are you apologizing ? what proof does mccain offer that people facing foreclosure are n't getting a second job ? moreover , what proof is offered that the rates do n't already eclipse the salary from a second job ? can people even find a second job in the current economy ? and , does he expect people to work double shifts for the next 30 years ? who does he expect is going to take care of their kids while working a double shift ? somehow , saying that people can change their fate is hopeful and empowering even if it is n't shown to be true but saying that small town 's people are bitter and cling to topics that do n't necessarily advance their overall well being is generalizing , unamerican and elitist , even if it is n't shown to be false . if obama is generalizing , so is mccain . although , i begin to wonder if there are any comments that can be made without extensive footnoting . i swear , everyone thinks they 're lawyers these days . opps , was that a general comment ? my bad . my soulful apologies to those reading this post who do n't in fact think they are lawyers . you really need to note that neither comments are contradictory . both candidates could be right or both could be wrong . it could even be that one is right and the other wrong . you pick . the way some people are praising mccain 's statements and dismissing obama 's tells us a lot more about them than it does about the candidates themselves . and of course vice versa .	c03q6pk	politics

the power of the federal government increased with the consent of the people , all of whom live in states the people do n't really care about matters of political philosophy . if the federal government wants to give them a new program they like , they 're for it . that 's why the constitution originally provided for the election of senators by state legislatures , who would have the interests of the state in mind . it 's unfortunate that we 've lost that check on federal power , but i think if enough people are informed about the benefits of power being held closer to the people , they 'll come around . i do n't think letting congress regulate commerce is a twisting '' of the words of the constitution . rather , it is a straight forward interpritation . i did n't say that the ability to regulate interstate commerce was a result of twisting the words of the constitution , i said that many of the things the federal government does today are justified by a nonsensical interpretation of the interstate commerce clause . how is drug prohibition regulating interstate commerce ? no straightforward interpretation '' of the clause would lead anyone to that conclusion . all those people arguing that the commerce clause should be very limited are in effect arguing against all those things . that is completely untrue . we are arguing that the federal government should n't be doing those things , not that they should n't be done at all . but this current trend of people labeling everything they do n't like as unconstitutional is just plain tacky , and gets us nowhere . the problem is that a lot of things the federal government does today are unconstitutional in my view , but obviously , the supreme court disagrees with me . plenty of things i 'd like to see , like universal healthcare , are unconstitutional '' at the federal level . my problem with a lot of these policies is not just that they 're unconstitutional , but even practically , they would be more effective if done at the state level . it 's far more difficult to get policies changed at the federal level than at the state level , because more people have to agree that it 's the right thing to do . furthermore , by concentrating so much power at the federal level , we 've made it ridiculously simple for corporations to purchase legislation . we 've also created a huge incentive for people to recklessly spend other people 's money . the people who spend the most get reelected , regardless of the national benefits that spending produces . the decentralized federal system that the founders intended would be more resistant to these phenomena .	c02z9yd	politics

just how would you go about lowering the reproduction rate ? by pushing the number down with your bare hands ? there are lots of things people talk about . education and industrialization tend to lower the reproduction rates . it does n't matter whether you claim to personally be against murdering or forced sterilization . both are justified using your theory . my theory ? you mean the theory that not having enough resources is bad ? i guess so , if you do n't consider genocide to be that bad . i do . but overpopulation is bad too . the reproduction rate goes down naturally as limits are approached . exactly . why is that ? the people who are alive do n't have enough to survive , thus the mortality rate goes up and they do n't reproduce as much . i do n't want people to die . that 's the point . and it 's not as if there 's a hard limit , and if we go 1 person over that limit , everyone will start dying . of course . nobody claimed otherwise . the transition is very gradual . an exponential graph of population has nothing to do with real life . more or less true . it 's more of a logistic curve , which starts out as approximating an exponential curve . if you want to avoid pain , kill yourself . life is painful . i do not want to stand by as excessive pain is caused in my fellow man . pain happens , but there 's no reason we should run into it headlong . conditions are poor because of lack of economic development in poor countries , not because of limited resources . economic development will help people get more out of limited resources . in the long term , however , this will increase the carrying capacity of the environment , which means that population will be allowed to grow more , and in the end we will run into the same problem of limited resources . we live in a world of limited resources . there 's limited land , water , shelter , clothing , etc , even in the more developed world . yup . so even in the developed world , which seems to be doing pretty well now , if we keep increasing indefinitely , things are not going to be so great . i have hope that we wo n't .	c0329t4	politics

it was n't a swat team , it was an investigation team . they did n't break down his door , nor raid '' the house . they took the man into custody . the news story says otherwise URL . says it was a swat team , says they did break down his door . took him and his kids and put them in a squad car for six hours . sounds like a raid to me . also , seriously , you 're going to make the argument that well , it 's not terrorists , so it 's no big deal '' ? the justification for using a swat team to execute a search warrant is that 1 the police believe that if they do n't act fast and with force the suspect may destroy the evidence , andor 2 they expect the suspect to resist violently . so , yes , i think it 's reasonable to expect that the government should restrain itself from this kind of behavior if a reasonable person would look at the facts of the case and say that neither of those instances is likely . given that the oig exists to investigate fraud , bribery , embezzlement , and bribery , it 's a large stretch to imagine that they will be used to go after simple defaults . student loan fraud '' essentially boils down to having delinquent loans where the state asserts that you lied on your loan application . that 's all they need . and then default '' turns into fraud . '' all they have to do is sign an affidavit and get a federal judge to sign off on it . unless , of course , you 're a libertarian conspiracy theorist who believes without evidence that any government entity will eventually be jackboots on necks . i do n't know why we need to discuss anything more than the case that 's in front of us . but in case you 're interested , the department of education is not the only federal agency that has its own force of armed federal officers . and as i pointed out elsewhere , every year the people who oversee department of education swat team and the officers on the swat team expect to be promoted , as do all federal employees . and for that to happen they have to show that they have conducted x number of investigations and served x number of warrants , and this year 's x has to be bigger than last year 's x. and they have to justify their budget for travel and expenses and equipment . so if fraud did n't necessitate a swat raid last year , it sure does this year , and something else will be added to the list next year . there 's no indication of brutalization of the man . just as all politics is local , i think one 's definition of whether brutalization '' has occurred depends on whether it 's a knee in your own back or someone else 's . even if you do n't consider it brutalization , '' breaking in a man 's door , dragging him out at gunpoint , and keeping him locked in a squad car with his three young children does seem to be to be egregious . although we do n't know the exact nature of the alleged crime , the inspector general is supposed to be investigating things like student loan fraud and embezzlement . if student loan fraud or embezzlement rate that kind of treatment , what doesn't rate that kind of treatment ? please shop your alarmist hyperbole in SUBREDDIT . i 'm sure they 'd take a looong swig of this koolaid . my apologies . i had no idea that SUBREDDIT was such a hotbed of lawandorder sentiment . it certainly never gave me that impression in the past . somehow i think that if it were the bush administration 's department of education doing this , there would be a much different reaction .	c1ykjz2	politics

the notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the constitution or the writings of our founding fathers . jefferson coined the phrase , but hey whatever , that 's cool . certainly the drafters of the declaration of independence and the constitution , both replete with references to god , would be aghast at the federal government 's hostility to religion . constitution contains no references to god whatsoever , but hey no biggie . and , again , jefferson , who was the principle author of the declaration of independence , specifically wrote about the necessity of the separation of church and state . madison , the principle author of the constitution , meanwhile wrote an alliance or coalition between government and religion can not be too carefully guarded against ... every new and successful example therefore of a perfect separation between ecclesiastical and civil matters is of importance ... religion and government will exist in greater purity , without rather than with the aid of government . but hey , ron paul really just claims to care about the constitution because it makes a nice slogan . i bet he 's never even read it .	c2040ac	politics

i disagree . i think having career politicians is one of the central problems of our democracy . career politicians have to care more about their own future than the public they represent . that is why they can be bought and sold like sheep by special interests . someone who already has another career is not such a slave to the election cycle , and therefore not such a slave to the 24hour news cycle . having career politicians also attracts the wrong people to the job powerhungry folks with shallow egos who yearn to win popularity contests rather than govern , instead of principled folks committed to others rather than themselves . this would also serve to flatten the decisionmaking process . right now , politicians do n't vote based on their principles or what the public wants they vote based on what will give the the most political capital . we do n't need or want political capitalists whose focus is on amassing a fortune of capital with which to secure themselves decades of power . the reason reps need so much political capital to get anything done in washington is precisely because there are so many career politicians with decades of political capital there already , who stand in the way of real progress . we need politicians who serve their fucking country for a few years and then go back to their normal life . i also think we need some buffet rules for congressional pay no elected rep in washington gets paid unless the budget is balanced no elected rep gets paid while we 're at war no elected rep is allowed to moonlight i.e . get paid for other work while holding the job no elected rep gets paid while congress 's approval rating is below 40 and all private stock holdings are considered a conflict of interest while on the job so a rep 's investments must enter a blind trust for the duration they hold office . these are perfectly reasonable strictures on a job that has such monumental implications for tens of millions of other americans .	c9lre0v	politics

according to hicks ' own testimony the c130 did n't even take off from tripoli until an hour after the final attack occurred at 515am , so whether or not the special forces guys were a part of the second rescue team was irrelevant . the first team flew out from tripoli within hours of the attack , and arrived in benghazi at 115am . q so you had mentioned that the first team from tripoli to benghazi arrived at 115 ? a right . q and was there a second team that was organized ? could you tell us about the second team ? a right . the second team the defense attache worked assiduously all night long to try to get the libyan military to respond in some way . early in the morning sorry , after we were formally notified by the prime minister , who called me , that chris had passed , the libyan military agreed to fly their c130 to benghazi and carry additional personnel to benghazi as reinforcements . because we at that time at that time , the third attack , the mortar attack at 515 , had not yet occurred , if i remember correctly . q so what time did the second rescue team ? ? a well , again , they flew i think that flight took off sometime between 600 and 630 a.m. q now , did any of the special forces folks , were they planning at any time to travel on that second aircraft ? a on the second , on the c130 ? yes . we fully intended for those guys to go as to the bs about fighter jets scrambling , again according to hicks and phillips , it was logistically impossible URL hicks recalled asking phillips , is there anything coming ? phillips replied that the nearest fighter planes were aviano aviano air base , in italy that he had been told that it would take 2 to 3 hours to get them airborne , but that there were no tanker assets near enough to support a flight from aviano , hicks recalled . the c130 left between 6 and 630 a.m. , so the four special forces troops would not have arrived in time to fend off the 515 a.m. attack on the cia annex in benghazi . this whole thing is house gop smoke and mirrors bs .	c9tpy17	politics

gerrymandering occurs in every state , in every election , and both parties are equally culpable . incumbents will do anything to stay in office , and gerrymandering is a successful way of doing it . it 's one of the reasons so few incumbents lose , and one of the few things republicans and democrats have in common . in new york , an initiative would do away with gerrymandering URL	clmvm3n	politics
if there were no ads on the media that would simply further ingrain people 's biases as most people have decided who they will vote for long before election day . and that method would then also leave the news media as the primary platform through which voters get their information . which supports my point that campaign finance reform would just give the media more power and candidates and their constituents less power . your best option is to go out and actually vote , not to change the laws . exercise the rights you already have . only 60 of voting age citizens register , and of those only a little over half actually vote . do n't listen to cynics who want a reason to mentally check out of the game while feeling superior to people about it . go vote .	clpc3u5	politics

everyone needs to calm the fuck down . this was inevitable , the gop needs 6 seats to take over . they have more than 6 senate races in states that obama lost by 20 points or more . also the second midterm of a two term presidency is always rough . there was absolutely no way the dems were going to hold the senate . on the same token the gop is absolutely screwed in 2016. they have 26 senate seats to defend v. 10 democratic seats . also at this point they have no one who can beat hillary . the midterms mean shit . if hillary is elected in 2016 it will be 16 years of dem rule . the supreme court will swing to the left . the leftward crawl of the country is not going away and without change the gop is screwed .	cln5wng	politics

first off , you said polls were saying trump beats hillary , and my response was a link directly disproving that . if we want to talk about who has momentum that 's a whole separate discussion . the simple fact is that while trump thrills the lowest common denominator of the gop base , he horrifies republican moderates and democrats while simultaneously revolting independents . he does great in elections where he can tee up off of poor jeb bush and where claiming we 're going to build a wall of flame at the mexican border is a massive applause line . but in an actual general election against an actual responsible adult people are going to quickly brush aside any lingering queasiness they might get from clinton because they are too busy vomiting at everything donald has to say .	d0k75no	politics

in another one of my posts i talk about how trump and bernie both appealed because of their similarities . i agree 100 people did n't support bernie because of his policies . they agreed because he stated why he wanted to run ... to make america a more equitable society . trump ran because he wants to maga . why did hillary or any other candidate say they ran ? i honestly ca n't think of the reason they ran other than to be president , which is selfserving . that 's why they did n't get the followings bernie and trump did . when i said democrats try to appeal to people in the know '' i meant that is how they position things on their platform . they get detailed and try to appeal to reason rather than emotion . was not insinuating one side is smarter than the other . i know some incredibly smart republicans and some really dumb democrats .	dcn1t0h	politics

i grew up unitarian universalist , and can confirm absolutely . there was an overall acceptance of everybody , so i know we attracted a lot of lgbtq congregants as well . we had a woman pastor , and the youth program was centered around visiting many different places of worship for different religions to learn about their beliefs . then , at the end of the year , each person makes a speech to the entire congregation about their journey and what they choose to believe . after that , they are accepted as an adult in the church . it was pretty cool , and really affected me in my formative years , teaching me tolerance , acceptance , and love for others .	e6o45f5	politics
i still do n't care and you will never get me to care . give it up . did russia swing the votes by climbing into the ballot boxes and actually changing votes from clinton to trump ? no . they swung votes by convincing actual voters to actually decide to actually not vote for clinton . this is called democracy . i literally do not care what causes a person to want to vote one way or another . so long as the vote results represent an accurate snapshot of what the voters want at the time of the election , then democracy has spoken . russian information campaigns , books , arguments on reddit , fortune cookies , or fucking alien mind control rays , if the voters ended up not wanting clinton , and the election correctly depicted this , then that is consistent with the fundamental philosophical definition of democracy . just drop this goddamn story already . i. do n't . fucking . care .	durckvl	politics

the fact a judge already ruled that the administration had 1530 days means that the judge is out for blood . the only way it can have a republican judge intervene is if it goes up . and even with the current crop of supreme court judges , they would most likely not be that split over this . besides , it 's not a civil issue , thus the supreme court ca n't get involved , iirc . it 's a criminal matter to ignore the rulings of a judge . so by issuing a contempt ruling and having the officials jailed for those charges , the only way the officials could get the matter overturned is by arguing a breech of civil rights , which wo n't even make it out of district court .	e1wuu11	politics

look at the trend before the 90 's . china is always actively manipulating their currency to keep it artificially low . there have been some explicit instances of currency devaluation , but their sop is to keep the rmb lower than it naturally would be . do you think that over the past 15 years china has n't become more ingrained in the global market , which would increase demand for the rmb and drive the value up ? if that is the case how do you think they keep their value constant at 17 ?	ey5fcgg	politics

and the term mob is a right wing term from fascists , which proves that you support fascism . then i guess the founding fathers were fascists '' democracy is nothing more than mob rule , where 51 of the people may take away the rights of the other 49 . '' thomas jefferson and i do care about human rights , but human rights can only be protected when a country is based on the rule of law , not the rule of man or rule of majority . to maintain the rule of law , you must have an independent judiciary . once you decide that the judiciary must always go with what the majority wants instead of what the law says , then human rights go away . instead you have tyranny of the majority . this is why poland nearly had its voting rights in the eu suspended they basically forced out their equivalent of the supreme court and replaced them with new appointments that favored their rightwing populist president . because that is a dangerous violation of judicial independence , the other 27 eu memberstates voted 261 to suspend poland 's voting rights in the union . the only reason it did n't happen is because suspending the voting rights of an eu member requires a unanimous vote the czech republic 's president , also a rightwing populist , sided with poland .	eiw5i9p	politics
