royal mail should either be fully nationalised , or the conditions that royal mail must adhere to i.e . it can not turn down mail because of where it is to be sent and must accept mail that has the correct stamps attached must be applied to private companies operating in the same sphere , what can not happen , and what will not work is to have royal mail provide what is an essential service , whilst having to compete against other companies that can choose to operate only the most lucrative parts of the business . there are some things that work well in the private sector , but i think the uk has been discovering for some time that quite a few things do n't and are then either subsidised by government or cut to the detriment of society generally public transport and some utilities for example .	c06vfmi	ukpolitics

the police will claim anything they can to get you to do something whether terror related or otherwise if they feel the end result is easier , i doubt that the police will actually arrest anyone for this kind of activity though . seriously i am a photographer in the uk , the things you have security guards and pcsos tell you although in my experience not the police generally that simply does n't make sense is hilarious . i 'm sure there will be stories of the police claiming something is illegal and getting people to act in a way that makes their lives easier , whether it relates to photography and using terror laws or something else . i was told i had to carry my driving license , insurance and mot certificate in my car by a traffic cop in 1999 , he told me that it was the law , but he would let me off this time , he knew full well it was n't . i have also been told by a pcso that i had to give him my name and address and submit to a search but without giving me a reason as to why or indeed informing me that i was somehow suspected of something there had been some sort of incident apparently , although that only became clear later , i declined . the law is complex , but if you know a little about police and pcso policing powers , you can prevent yourself from being conned into doing something that is not required by law . a police officer can ask you to do anything at all , if you do it , you do it voluntarily , there are only a small number of things you can be compelled to do . do n't confuse the law with the actions of some police officers and especially not with the actions of pcsos .	c08wi1t	ukpolitics

yes it was his idea and at his insistence that the promotion of faith schools went ahead , even though he was warned that it could lead to further islamic extremism in british society . just because he did n't bend over backwards to appease all catholic desires does n't mean he did n't push for more faith schools . look at the stuff he comes out with now . my point is that i fail to see how his particular religious convictions could have pushed him into doing something that diminished his own particular brand of religions 'power ' in the uk . personally i have no issue with religious schools as long as they perform and meet the usual standards . hell , two of my kids go to a cofe school , primarily because it is the best school in academic terms i could get them into . so i guess my point is that whilst this has a vague relationship with religion , i fail to see how his religious motivation could have been a driving factor and i could see nonreligious people taking the same position . have you seen him or heard him talk since he stepped down ? he 's practically become a spokesperson for religion . attacking secularity at every given opportunity he gets . he 's been giving a lecture course in america about how great religion is and criticising secularity . i have , but frankly he does n't make bush look like an atheist ... essentially i am accusing you of using hyperbole to make an otherwise valid point . yes , since leaving office blair has come 'out ' of the closet to a greater or lesser degree , although i do wonder how much of that is about getting lucrative speaking engagements and how much is his new freedom to act as he now does . but the article said it was due to his religious views . if i find it i 'll post it . please do because i have seen nothing to that effect . do you bother reading anything ? you seriously have no idea how the nutt sacking is related to what i 'm saying but argue anyway ? how the hell can anyone in britain have missed the whole fiasco ? i , like most people , read a fair amount about it , discussed it with various people i know , including labour and lib dem members sorry , i still stay clear of the tory clique and most agree that it comes down to a government , or factions within it being worried about the political ramifications and the fact that there was a feeling that nutt spoke 'out of turn ' . indeed the consensus that it was the right move politically even given the fallout seems somewhat solid . it is felt , rightly or wrongly , that the british , or at least the segments that vote , are still antilegalisation . there another aspect too , that is to say that nutt had a point , but one that breaks down when taken in context . in short , people do n't use cannabis on its own , they use it in conjunction with alchohol and other drugs at the weekend and then use it when they ca n't afford a hangover or downer . in short , it may be less harmful on its own , but it often is n't used like that . i could go on into the workplace and social bits discussed , but it is somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion , namely that religion played some part . just because religious people here are n't as extreme as in america does n't mean they do n't have religious views that impact their policies . people are n't fundie or secular , there 's a whole spectrum . i agree with that , and i have no issue with peoples morals and ethics , wherever they are derived from having an impact on policy . i am simply stating that policy on the basis of any given religious position is almost unheard of , secular positions are the norm , we regularily pass legislation that ensures that no one religion is preeminent which sort of neutralises the whole established church thing , and more importantly religion is rarely part of the political or even social dialogue . 'm not saying our government is as religious as the us . i did n't suggest you did . but there has been influence for a while now and it may even get worse . again , i would respectfully disagree . the uk is becoming less religous but more aware of perceived discrimination , that has had an effect on minority groups generally and the government has legislated to protect them but in that sense it is more that beliefs and other minority positions are becoming more prominent . in short it is n't about religion as much as it is about diversity .	c0g7bzf	ukpolitics

two houses , the commons and the lords . the lords is hereditary and government appointed . the commons is completely elected , and each mp is elected in a first past the post system , in their constituency . they start the bills , then the lords looks over and finalises them , when it is signed into law by the queen she does n't ever say no , and has no real power to . the party that reaches a certain threshold of mps in the commons forms the government and appoints a cabinet of their own mps , with positions such as home secretary , foreign secretary etc . the second party forms the opposition , with an opposition cabinet with shadow as they are called secretaries for all the positions in the actual cabinet . an election must be called at the governments choosing within 5 years of the start of their term . there is no limit on terms , even for prime ministers . if no government passes this threshold , then there is a hung parliament with no overall control . the incumbent will try and reach agreements with smaller parties to form a new majority , if not , another election will be held soon . afaik	c0onjoj	ukpolitics

my greatest worry is that we will abolish '' the monarchy on their terms . so we will let them keep all the land they own , the estates , the wealth , etc . which really they have just stolen from the nation over generations . of course , once this is done it would be practically impossible to convince people to then take the land back off the exaristocracy , as they will say it 's their land ! , as though god himself gave it to them . i would n't be surprised if the royal family do effectively abolish the monarchy themselves so they can be sure in maintaining the land , the diplomatic jobs , etc .	c17d5s6	ukpolitics

this is a good development for justice and crime prevention . but ah , the language of politics . new labour decided they want to do something about the yoots . they invented antisocial behaviour '' a meaningless term that criminalises thousands while offering no solution to the perceived problem . tories get into power and rightly say enough of this nonsense '' , and now people like the op say things like hug a hoody '' sic like they 're being soft on crime .	c0veli8	ukpolitics
... this idiocy , this 'cut the administrators ' bullshit is really annoying . if you want the police to do the whole arresting thing properly and have the courts convict , there will be paperwork , ongoing paperwork evidence , court dates , statements etc.. . there will also be administration , leave requests , rotas , sick leave , community meetings , vehicle maintenance , building maintenance , technical support , it contracts and a fuck ton of other things . when you sack an administrator who probably gets paid 12k a year on average ... you end up pulling someone else to do it , probably from the front line . i would also say that whilst things like 'community engagement ' can be a colossal waste of time , they can also be quite useful , the idea that the police can simply police a community without support or contact , or feedback is insane , the issue is n't community engagement it is the way it is carried out . even more problematical is that the fear of crime is a huge driver of police priorities and it 's a waste of police resources , that fear comes because our communities have changed and are less cohesive.. so yeah , it 's going to be your average police officer who 'll get shafted , either because they end up getting binned or because they end up having to do all the shit jobs that had been farmed out .	c0z4nfm	ukpolitics
well , it 's all very promising so far , as it should be considering the libs and the tories were largely in agreement on these issues . the question is , can it produce results ? similar things were expected in the us from obama when he took over from bush , but it became clear quite early on that he was n't interesting in pursuing the crimes of the last administration . might be the same here .	c0qfpy1	ukpolitics
it 's a trap ! context is important if we 're talking about a hypothetical fully able protester then things are slightly different than if we 're talking about mcintyre . i do n't think that 's patronising , it 's simple reality . there 's an ambiguity in your quote it 's not clear who is throwing the stones , the person talking or the anarchists at the helm . once we know mcintyre is talking , it 's clear that it was n't him who was throwing the stones . similarly 'fight ' takes on a different meaning and is n't about physical confrontation but political campaigning . having said that , if brown had read out this quote near the start of the interview i.e . before we found out mcintryre could n't power his own wheelchair so would not be capable of throwing stones and then asked mcintyre whether he threw stones at the police that would n't have been nearly as bad as asking him about rolling towards the police . i would still have a problem with it , as i think there 's a political element to asking what he did to provoke the attack as demonstrated by the molestation example , but i think it would be a lot more legitimate than what he actually asked . however , brown did n't ask if mcintyre had provoked the police , he asked if he rolled towards them which is not a provocative thing to do . brown is trying to imply it 's provocative , but it is n't actually provocative . so even if it was legitimate to ask whether he had done something provocative it still would n't have been legitimate to ask whether he had rolled towards the police .	c19aapz	ukpolitics

i have to agree with you . this is the one chance for the lib dems to force the reforms needed to give them the position they deserve . all other policies after this can be addressed afterwards , as there will likely be another general election sooner rather than later and if the lib dems lose their seats , everything will have been for nothing . it 's nice that clegg 's playing fair , but if the tories had their way , they 'd shut the lib dems out of government and block all talk of reform . he needs to remember that the tories are only willing to do this in the hopes of another election soon to remove the need for the lib dems . permanent reform should be the essential item on the agenda . it 's the only way forward and he should n't cave in to temptation . clegg has to remember he represents the opinion that the current voting system is flawed . if enough of the nation stand up to say we need reform and tell clegg we want him to do the right thing and push this reform through whoever he allies with , we will have completed the first step in fixing society and creating a progressive parliament that reflects the desires of all society . i 'm anxious to see what he decides , and i hope he makes the right choice . the tories are not to be trusted here .	c0po8qu	ukpolitics

cctv is n't the problem , i live in london and i quite like cctv and it makes me feel safer , especially at night when i get off the train by myself . the problem was this lot passed under the pretence of combating terrorism terrorism act 2000 widens the definition of terrorism to apply to domestic terrorism and include any political , religious or ideological '' cause that uses or threatens violence against people or property creates new offences of inciting terrorism enhances police powers , including stop and search and precharge detention for seven days outlaws terrorist groups , including alqaeda . antiterrorism , crime and security act 2001 initially enabled the home secretary to indefinitely detain , without charge or trial , foreign nationals who are suspected of terrorism a system now replaced with control orders after the house of lords ruling in a and others extends executive powers over freezing bank accounts and assets of suspected terrorists . prevention of terrorism act 2005 introduces control orders , which allow the government to restrict the activities of individuals it suspects of involvement in terroristrelated activity '' , but for whom there is not sufficient evidence to charge . terrorism act 2006 extends the precharge detention period from 14 to 28 days the criminal justice act 2003 had increased it from seven to 14 days introduces a prohibition on the glorification '' of terrorism . counterterrorism act 2008 enables postcharge questioning of terrorist suspects allows constables to take fingerprints and dna samples from individuals subject to control orders amends the definition of terrorism by inserting a racial cause . not to mention the fact that without serious opposition we would also have 90 days detention and the continued suspesion of habeus corpus . these laws have been consistently misused by the police and i myself have been stopped with an american friend of mine after i took a photo of him in front of the houses of parliament . considering i have been round the houses of parliament a few times and personally know a handful of mps , i could n't help but think that such a reaction was disproportionate .	c1ve2mw	ukpolitics

this is an area that is best dealt with on a national basis , not at the eu level . the eu must set basic limits which member countries are free to exceed but not to drop below . otherwise we risk a race to the bottom in tough economic times . we need a base level in terms and conditions , healthcare , benefits etc . we 've already seen that differing levels of unemployment benefits has led to benefit tourism . it is n't the idea behind some of these policies i 'm opposed to , it is the degree of them ... i like good benefits at sustainable levels . i agree with this . in difficult times there 's a case for decreasing benefits across the eu but not unilaterally by a single country . i think france has too much influence at the moment . currently the system is way too top heavy with guarantees to workers . strongly disagree . the tables are very much tilted towards the employer . the only exception is for some small businesses . there are ways round that without further eroding workers ' rights . 4 weeks ' vacation ? i do n't think anyone should be guaranteed one minute of vacation . there 's a danger of a race to the bottom here . the same argument can be applied to paid vacation as to the minimum wage . that said , the equality aspects i 'm for , but i do n't see how it is necessary for the eu to be involved . the uk is full of adults and they can write and enforce their own laws . europe is full of adults too . my town is full of adults for that matter . some things should be decided locally , some nationally and some by the eu . in my opinion the balance is badly wrong at times , but equality law needs to be set at the level of the eu . again member countries should be free to exceed but not to drop below . the most egregious , in my opinion , of the guaranteed rights are those for when a company fails . especially seniority rights . this is the sort of thing that cripples an economy and prevents it from being able to nimbly adapt to changes . disagree strongly . i 've seen too many people being stuffed when their employer has gone bust , while the directors walk off without necessarily losing all that much . employer should be required to take out insurance or post a bond to make sure they can meet their obligations to staff and suppliers if they cease trading . never mind the obscene minimum 26 weeks of maternity leave . simple to sort this out . give the same amount of leave to the father . countries like norway beat us hollow on decent paternitymaternity leave . maybe this would help to stop our kids being so messed up .	c2uczrc	ukpolitics

in real capitalism , the best products can compete with each other and the consumer can benefit by choosing between these . this competition can drive down prices . if the prices are as low as possible , competing companies will have to improve service . either way , the competition benefits the consumer . competition generally improves things , and makes things stronger . check out evolution . i 'm not saying this is a colution to cornyism , but cronyism prevents this from happening . when somebody gets a job , or makes a sale , based not on outcompeting their rivals , but via corruption , this undermines capitalism and the benefits that it can bring .	c1ho4oz	ukpolitics
i think it 's largely the depression we 're in . it is a genuine problem , especially for students who are poor at the best of times , and it 's given a certain amount of extra weight to the traditional protest platforms that appeal to students . plus , we have tories back in government again , and that 's brought out quite a few people who want to relive the 80 's , in some cases vicariously , in an attempt to recapture their youth or just as a way of coping with their vague guilt over the last decade or so when many lefties essentially sold out to the nulabour dream . while i do n't think this is such a big part of actions on the ground , i do think it has a hell of a lot to do with the way certain parts of the media are covering protests , in particular the guardian . certain aspects of the left do feel happier when they are playing the underdog fighting the man than they ever would if they were running the show . and to top this off , we have the internet . which is a game changer . no longer is communicating with people outside your circle an arduous task , it 's something you can do with minimal effort while sitting on the can or waiting for the bus . it 's so much easier to get your voice out there today , so a protest is something you can hear about almost instantly , often with multiple sources of live coverage . and you can know about it before it happens , so you can join in easily . you do n't need to go to the meetings to get involved . so all in all , a perfect storm of protesting . not only do we have a laundry list of things to be genuinely upset about , it 's far easier to be a part of things .	c2xvobo	ukpolitics

pure sophistry . the theory of permanent revolution insists that in country 's with a belated capitalist development , only the working class , leading the oppressed masses , the majority of the population , can resolve the democratic tasks of the revolution ie . democratic rights such as freedom of the press , land rights etc . trotsky and lenin led the russian revolution , which overthrew a tsarist autocracy hated by the majority of the russian people , but propped up by the major powers . th bolsheviks led a revolution supported by the majority of the population , against a dictatorial regime how is that antidemocratic ? and for the record , the october revolution was virtually bloodless ... fighting began when the fascists , monarchists and aristocrats took up arms against a government supported by the majority of the population . in that endeavour they were supported by 13 imperialist contingents the same governments that sent millions of young men to their deaths in ww1 , would not allow a peaceful workers government to exist ... that great democrat , churchill called for the bolshevik baby to be strangled in its crib he was a fervent supporter of hitler and mussolini well into the 30 's ... you should read more , and think more critically ...	c234qi0	ukpolitics

firstly it 's an appeal to hypocrisy , so it does n't make the gaurdian any less credible when reporting tax avoidance . secondly , the guido fawkes article relates to the sale of the autotrader , and the guardian were never due any tax on it in the first place , because they reinvested the money URL . it 's not some loophole in a legal grey area that is being exploited , it 's a government approved tax relief scheme . all it shows is how ignorant guido fawkes is to compare it to the kind of avoidance vodafone and others get up to . thirdly , the private eye piece that was regurgitated in some of those blogs , was the thinnest possible evidence you could imagine . it 's claimed that some accountants from a firm that the guardian uses , might have operated via luxemburg.. notice the story died quickly . the tax bill they were claimed to have dodged was in fact the autotrader sale in 2010 , which again , they were never liable for tax on . also remember that , except for 2010 when they sold the autotrader , the guardian makes a loss almost every year . they 've been given perhaps a decade before they go under .	c6uhmsx	ukpolitics
the same argument about progressive income tax kind of applies to ni . basically ni contributions cap out above a certain income . whereas tax rate caps out above 150k . as its the rate that caps out rather than the actual contributions its not quite hte same . but i see no reason why there should n't be another taxband that kicks in at 1 million , and another one that kicks in at 5 million . that would be more progressive . so in terms of the very wealthy those who earn more than 150k the income tax is n't progressive at all , in fact its regressive ... though noone 's going to be shedding tears for the lower wealthy who lose a higher portion of their disposable income than the higher wealthy do !	c6fxhp7	ukpolitics

it 's a while since i closed my business , but i 'm fairly sure corporation tax is not a tax on post tax profits . in the rare case that a company is taxed twice usually because of dividend income to the company you can claim relief from double taxation . a small company is defined as one with a profit of 300,000 or less . there 's some marginal relief above that level but i was never in any danger of having to investigate how that works ... i 'm in favour of a lower tax rate for small companies because in the uk game is very much rigged to favour the bigger players , and anything which levels things up a bit is to be welcomed . one argument hmrc has raised against a lower tax rate for small companies is that bigger companies have been artificially splitting up into smaller ones as a tax avoidance strategy .	c444qkx	ukpolitics

ugh bloody free enteprise group again . the one thing that would make sense here is the abolishment of the scotland , wales and northern ireland offices , which are largely redundant with devolution . have a minister for devolved regions '' or the like . merging defra and energy would be an awful move and probably come on the back of weakening the regulatory powers of both departments . and a strong business and skills department is needed as a counterweight for the treasury . the way to really save money in government would be to sell off expensive whitehall buildings and start buying cheaper properties outside london .	cdh4prl	ukpolitics

legally ? yes . all devolution is just that , devolution . parliament can revoke it unlike granting of independence to colonies at will , and the enabling legislation makes it clear that parliament in no way surrenders any power . the eu echr is at best a form of delegated legislation , and at worse if you take the ecj 's view , for example a constitutional alteration of the hierarchy of law . in either case , the 'manner and form ' doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty means parliament is still sovereign . parliament can restrict or tamper its sovereignty however parliament wants , so long as a future parliament can undo the restriction . in the eu 's case , any parliament can simply repeal the 1972 ec act though for various reasons , this would be a profoundly stupid thing to do , even for eurosceptics . politically ? what does it matter ? it 's accepted that parliament can make or unmake any law . if people stop accepting that to the point that they no longer obey parliament , then it 's a silly debate . if no one is obeying the constitution , then a discussion about the constitution 's applicability is a moot point , surely ? the more interesting point that the late lord bingham got at is can parliament act in a way inconsistent with sovereignty ? there 's a sort of developing judicial 'reserve argument ' that argues that parliament 's sovereignty only exists when it acts 'like parliament ' . the idea of this argument is to give a potential future court a way of taking the sting out of draconian legislation without creating a constitutional crisis . effectively , the court will just say ' i know it says detention for 180 days , but parliament ca n't actually mean that because it would never intend to . therefore i 'm reading this as a meaningless part of the statute ' .	c82xnw4	ukpolitics
we live in a very different time to 1900. when labour was founded , there was space in the political environment for a leftist party , as neither the conservatives nor the liberals occupied that space . today , labour firmly occupies the left of politics , regardless of its centrism . although it may not pursue grand visions of nationalisation anymore , it is very much the practical voice of the left , being the only leftleaning party capable of entering government . i fail to see how a trade unions party could make any headway in the highly centrist theatre of british politics . if we had a proportional system , i 'd imagine that there would be room for the greens on the left , but i really doubt there would be much appetite for a trade unions party .	cayvo9i	ukpolitics

hitler told hermann rauschning , a prussian who briefly worked for the nazis before rejecting them and fleeing the country , that he had admired much of the thinking of the revolutionaries he had known as a young man but he felt that they had been talkers , not doers . i have put into practice what these peddlers and pen pushers have timidly begun , he boasted , adding that the whole of national socialism was based on marx . marx s error , hitler believed , had been to foster class war instead of national unity to set workers against industrialists instead of conscripting both groups into a corporatist order . his aim , he told his economic adviser , otto wagener , was to convert the german volk to socialism without simply killing off the old individualists by which he meant the bankers and factory owners who could , he thought , serve socialism better by generating revenue for the state . what marxism , leninism and stalinism failed to accomplish , he told wagener , we shall be in a position to achieve .	cfpkuoj	ukpolitics
it 's not about nationality , it 's about residence . plenty of scottish '' students have to pay if they 're normally resident elsewhere . please stop making things about nationality when they 're not . it 's not particularly helpful in any debate . oh please , it 's not based on nationality only because there is no scottish nationality , in that there is no scottish passport . there are essentially the same thing in this case , it 's not that many students emigrate from england to scotland or from scotland to england years before they apply to university anyway . i think pedantry is particularly helpful in any debate . in what way is that discrimination ? people who were living in scotland before applying to a scottish university have no tuition fees , people who were living in england , wales or northern ireland have to rack up 28,000 or so in debt to go to a scottish university . how is that not discrimination ? however , people who were living in england before applying to an english university do not have free tuition fees . thus , the scottish government discriminates between english people and scottish people or rather people who were living in england or scotland , who are almost invariably english and scottish respectively in their admissions to their universities because they pay different fees , while the de facto english government does not discriminate between english and scottish people in their admission to english universities . because they pay the same fees how is that not discrimination ?	cn8kvn9	ukpolitics

in what way is it not democratic ? because nigel farage told you so or because you thought carefully about how supranational democratic institutions should operate ? a directly elected eu parliament and your elected national governments in the council form the bicameral legislator , with the executive in the commission , as of this year , selected from among candidates that run against each other on an open platform , with the candidate from the largest group postthe election getting the chance to go to council and ask for the chance which must be voted to form a coalition in the parliament to be elected as commission president . this indirect manner is very similar to the way prime ministers are instated in the uk . all legislation must pass through both of the legislators in the case of the single market or through the council in case of anything else . all foreign and security policy , defence policy , education , taxation , healthcare and social policy remain the exclusive competence of the member states , with the eu providing tools for coordination , policy exchange and knowledge sharing , as well as benchmarking of these activities should member states voluntarily agree to them . the eu is very very very limited in power and scope .	cn1c43j	ukpolitics

the political compass is ridiculously flawed . it has a number of leading questions which people will either be unable to answer , or be forced to answer in a way the authors of the test deem leftlibertarian . as a result , the test shunts everyone towards the bottom left . the test authors then shove near every real mainstream political party and politician into the upper left corner to make people who take the test think wow , these fascist cunts do n't share my views at all , time to vote for the greens even though i 'm clearly centreright outside of the bizarre world that is this test '' . seriously , look at this shit URL they put the fucking leader of the communist party of china further to the economic right than just about anyone else . from this alone it should be obvious that the authors of the test have no real methodology to making these charts comparing politicians and political parties beyond the more we hate this person , the more we are gona cram them in the top right '' . and that 's the tl dr , now for the indepth analysis . the author 's bias using the phrase neoliberal orthodoxy '' , neoliberal agenda '' and similar multiple times is a clear indication of the political views of the test writers , which is strongly leftwing . it 's akin to saying socialist agenda '' or marxist agenda '' which would act as an indication the author is strongly rightwing . they 've done a relatively good job avoiding other blatant examples of this , so we have to look into what questions they ask . leading and flawed questions a lot of the questions on the test are leading . in almost all these cases , they will make even the most staunchly rightwing testtaker select the leftleaning answer . as a result , people who are clearly on the economic right will still typically receive a leftleaning test result . example 1 if economic globalisation is inevitable , it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of transnational corporations . '' there is no way for people who believe the interests of corporations and humanity are identical to answer this . when queried on this , the test authors basically ignored the criticism . so even the most economically rightwing person will give the leftleaning answer of disagree . example 2 because corporations can not be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment , they require regulation . '' this question outright states to the reader corporations can not be trusted '' . those who believe corporations can be trusted are once again left unable to answer and forced towards the left leaning answer , similar to example 1. example 3 it is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society . people who believe that financial systems are actually useful i.e anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of finance and economics are once again left unable to answer this question , as they believe those who 'manipulate money ' do contribute to society . example 4 a significant advantage of a oneparty state is that it avoids all the arguments that delay progress in a democratic political system . '' you can believe this is true without supporting a oneparty state , but the test will give you increased authoritarianism for agreeing with this . example 5 abstract art that does n't represent anything should n't be considered art at all . '' someone 's opinion on this has no bearing on their political views . example 6 multinational companies are unethically exploiting the plant genetic resources of developing countries . '' this question does n't actually even make sense . plant genetic resources '' are not a thing that can be exploited , and seems to indicate the authors do n't actually know what genetics are . of course , being a leading question , most people will select agree which is the leftwing response . example 7 pornography , depicting consenting adults , should be legal for the adult population . '' the left has no unified views on this feminism is split into proporn and antiporn camps on this despite both groups being broadly leftwing . this is not an appropriate question if it 's unclear which side the left adopts on this issue . example 8 astrology accurately explains many things '' the test authors decided that agreeing with this is a conservative belief and that disagreeing with this is a liberal belief . in reality , leftleaning people seem more likely to believe in astrology than rightleaning people . citation URL example 9 governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public . '' even the most economically rightwing person will not believe that fraud should be permitted . hence everyone will put the leftwing response to this question . the results page just so you do n't have to go through the test , here 's one i cooked up earlier URL many of the phrases on this page are harsh criticisms of right leaning governments , while it simultaneously completely avoids all criticism of leftleaning politics . i 'm not going through them all because it 's all bad , but i 'm just pointing out the worst examples here . example 1 which couples social darwinian rightwing economics '' rightwing economics are not inherently social darwinian '' . this is a clear attempt by the test authors to make people thing that capitalists mass murdering fascists . example 2 hitler , on an economic scale , was not an extreme rightwinger . his economic policies were broadly keynesian '' this is bad history . hitler mostly ignored economic policy outside of war preparations , and by 1940 germany had a looting economy that was dependant on conquest of new territory to remain functional . this has nothing to do with keynesian economics . example 3 paradoxically , the free market '' , in neocon parlance , also allows for the largescale subsidy of the militaryindustrial complex '' this is the only time a modern political ideology is singled out for direct criticism . take the test as a political party seriously , take the test . take it acting as one of the political parties that are ranked on the compass . take it acting as the most extreme viewpoints of that political party . see if you can push it anywhere near as rightleaning and authoritarian as they have listed it as on the chart op linked . the cynic in me says the test exists for the purpose of encouraging more people to vote for hardleft parties by deceiving them into believing that their policitcal views align with them .	cr4lgqn	ukpolitics

i do n't pray that gay people turn straight i do n't know if pence does . i pray for peace , for love , for hope , for change . ok , i 'm sure pence does too . i highly doubt he 's praying for war , hate , loss of hope and stagnation . some strange version of christian virtue well no , they already outlawed and he wanted to keep it that way because he though they would encourasge drug use . then , when people start getting hiv , you pray on it in recent interviews , local , state and federal health officials said mr. pence initially held firm . so as they struggled to contain the spread of h.i.v. , the officials embarked on a behindthescenes effort over several weeks to persuade him to change his mind , using political pressure , research and pleas for help from this remote , poor community . on march 23 , more than two months after the outbreak was detected , mr. pence said he was going to go home and pray on it . he spoke to the sheriff the next night . two days later , he issued an executive order allowing syringes to be distributed in scott county . so basically , he went home , sought guidance in a way that he thought appropriate , and changed his mind . he did n't try to pray '' it away . finally , when the hiv has really gotten to everyone 90 people . in a nutshell , there was an emergency , he had an opinion that handing out needles would lead to more drug use . initially he opposed it , but in the end changed his mind and allowed them . so he let go of one of his firmest convictions for the good of his state . does that sound like a man steeped in ideology and immorality to you ? does that sound like a vicious person , or just a normal human ? not many people change their minds or admit they were wrong . i 'm not trying to make it like he 's a saint , i 'm not a conservative , but this idea that he 's a nasty mean fascist dinosaur is clearly wrong . if only certain leftist hacks would change their minds so fast .	d9w0j8t	ukpolitics

average hours worked is down probably because people are employed more precariously on zero hours contracts . hours are down so we must be on precarious zero hour contracts , but if hours were up you 'd be telling me that we 're all being forced into working more by the capitalist machine even though we 're getting richer . those household income figures you cited include state support and benefits so it 's not like the free market is exactly stepping in to provide the necessary impetus . well , i 'm not a completely laissezfaire capitalist who thinks the government should n't play any role in the economy . redistribution can help to reduce poverty and redistribute the fruits of growth better , and i have no problem with that . but i do n't think it follows that we should overthrow the entire capitalist system . largely capitalist mixed economies work best . and anyway , this improvement in living standards is in spite of not because of , capitalism . you think all technological advancement would just stop if we did n't have a market economy ? this is quite a different argument . earlier you were saying that capitalism meant living standards stagnated or got worse . now that 's been disproved you 're saying that capitalism just slowed down improvements in living standards , which still happened . but if we manage to see all these improvements under capitalism , then capitalism really ca n't be that bad . i ca n't disprove the claim that capitalism is slowing down the rate of improvement in living standards , it 's basically unfalsifiable . i would say that in the two sort of experiments we have , where we split germany in korea in half , the more capitalist side performed better in both cases . and that it 's extremely odd that china and india 's capitalist reforms coincided with their poverty falling most rapidly if capitalism is always a drag on living standards . and technology can be transferred between countries quite easily , so it seems implausible that the vast income differences between countries are largely driven by technology . and that there are plenty of plausible arguments for why capitalism might accelerate either the creation or the adoption of technology . but that 's not conclusive evidence , and i do n't believe any such evidence exists . you can either work or starve . this has been true for all of human history . parttime wages wo n't even cover the costs of housing in most cases . you actually ca n't go out and live in a commune , because almost all land is held privately by capitalists . you 'd struggle to live selfsufficiently , because capitalism has only indoctrinated you from birth with the skills necessarily to be a cog in the industrial machine , which are n't very useful to a wouldbe survivalist . it 's certainly difficult to avoid formal work in our society as it was in soviet russia he who does not work , neither shall he eat '' was said by lenin , not milton friedman . you have to give up quite a lot and put effort into it . but it 's neither impossible nor illegal .	d59ak4t	ukpolitics

give me a fucking break . islam is a set of ideals to which you voluntarily subscribe . it is perfectly fine to criticise , or even dislike , somebody for the beliefs they choose to hold . raceethnicity , sex , sexuality , disability etc are all characteristics which you can not change . that 's why it 's wrong to treat people differently based on those characteristics . if somebody was a devilworshipper , a scientologist , or a 911 truther again , voluntarilyheld beliefs , most of us would think less of them because of those beliefs . yet it would be insane to accuse somebody of being scientologiphobic . and if you wear a crazy costume in the streets , people will absolutely avoid you or make comments . so really , what the hell is islamophobia '' supposed to mean ? it seems to me an attempt to lump islam in with race , so that criticising islam would be akin to being racist forgetting that there are black muslims zambiaethiopia , southeast asian muslims indonesia , arab muslims , caucasianwhite muslims , mediterranean muslims and pretty much every other race as you 'd expect with a belief system .	d8ubka0	ukpolitics

relevance ? you said that neoliberalism mainly started during maggie 's time . i pointed out this is incorrect and linked you a source with more information . as i said i did n't think you 'd be interested , but i 've done all i can . the falling oil price was undoubtedly the cause of their crisis . is this serious ? are you serious ? oil prices and venezuela 's credit rating is easily found on google . their credit rating has been down in the negative '' position since the start of 2012 and oil prices stayed buoyant until mid2014 . additionally between mid2001 to mid2003 they were negative as well but during that time , oil prices rose from 30 a barrel to 40 a barrel a 30 rise . there 's absolutely no corellation between oil prices and their economy . they just have no idea how to run an economy and they keep trying to do things that are very clearly shown to cause huge problems . again nobody is wanting to model our economy after theirs your strawmanning is dull two large factors that damage their economy besides general mismanagement is the lack of international investment due to them seizing privately held assets for minor political reasons , and for attempting to force price controls that benefit the black market and lead to shortages . and here we have jeremy who wanted to seize privately held assets for minor political reasons and want to introduce price controls . oh , and he 's spent years singing the praises of the venezuelan economy .	dj5am2q	ukpolitics

just as we did n't even know half of what went on in nazi germany till afterwards , we do n't know half of what goes on in russia now . in the following article , it says it 's likely they 've used the nerve agent before but people did n't realise URL it s entirely likely that we have seen someone expire from this and not realized it , said daniel m. gerstein , a former senior official at the united states department of homeland security who is now at the rand corporation . we realized in this case because they were found unresponsive on a park bench . had it been a higher dose , maybe they would have died and we would have thought it was natural causes. basically boris is right . obama , cameron , merkel and hollande made a mistake in 2014 when they did n't react strongly enough to putin seizing crimea . even worse , they did n't really react to the 298 dutch people who died in mh17 . i really do n't know why the dutch govt did n't push hard for severe sanctions . and the lack of reaction emboldened putin to become more and more brazen . he probably thought mrs may was weak and would n't react he must have got the shock of his life the way she 's been escalating and escalating this , and getting other countries to line up and do something including the united states . she 's been doggedly at it for two weeks now , and boris has been banging on about crimea , and putin must be howling because it 's clear that they mean to go on and on and on till they get some results .	dw7xq7p	ukpolitics

because comments about a country 's pacifism and lack of balls '' implies a desire for an aggressive , violent way to keep a certain way of life which is exactly how the mutaween in islamic countries operate . all abrahamic faiths call for the murder of 'nonbelievers ' it 's not exactly exclusive to islam . our culture is n't exactly going to magically become however someone defines it and stay that way with the removal of all immigrants . there are many factors as to why its changing as cultures do . we used to drown people and predict the future from the death spasms as part of our culture centuries ago some things change and some things do n't . the only way to preserve it is to become an isolated nation with a totalitarian and authoritarian government limiting out media , etc . it 's foolish to rally against it and it 's foolish to blame 14 of the population for change when it 's up to the other 86 to pass on and maintain their own culture . perhaps you could remind me why there are few christians of jews in predominantly islamic controlled nations ? so , again , we should behave as they do and kick out or kill anyone that does n't conform ? return to the spanish method of forcing jews to convert and sending an inquisition after them to make sure it 's genuine ? or maybe burn people on pyres again ? we 're not innocent of those crimes ourselves in the west . i can see the point you 're trying to make but you 're just proving mine . both parties want a certain group kicked out or removed via violent means because it is n't part of a perceived way of life '' .	dsypes1	ukpolitics
i get the impression the people of austria are concerned about what they see happening in countries german and elsewhere in the west and want to protect against that , which is fair enough , but i assume most people do n't actually support these farright neonazi types ? the way i often hear it reported is that austrians are supporting and voting for farright racists , which seems unlikely .	e1ih01x	ukpolitics

i agree that corbyn should be the obvious choice . but as you said , the pm needs to command a majority in the hoc , which corbyn does not . since corbyn falls short of this , the only logical option is to look for someone else . at that point convention is not clear , but i definitely do n't agree with you that it ca n't be a backbencher or member of a 3rd party .	f3lyacm	ukpolitics

good lord . read the statement i quoted . corbyn received a briefing from the security forces on wednesday morning , and his spokesman said it had now become clear that the russian state had been directly involved in the attack . it s clear now that very strong evidence points to russian state culpability , and obviously jeremy condemns the russian state for that culpability , he said .	eoqi2zv	ukpolitics

it s going to be hilarious corbyn could just about hold his own versus may as she wasn t very good at pmqs . but remember how effortless cameron made his weekly destruction of corbyn look , it was part of the reason for his really low polling ratings . he s got to really raise his game versus johnson as going up against somebody with an actual personality and wit will really show his shortcomings . pmqs is theatre and very public facing , and i don t think it will go well for corbyn if he doesn t make a big improvement .	eupzsss	ukpolitics
