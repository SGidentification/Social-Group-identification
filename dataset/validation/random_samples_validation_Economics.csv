too long . i 'll make a quick summary and try to make it somewhat comprehensible . when unions were roughly 37 of the work force wages across the board were higher . we had a larger middle class as a result . the reasoning behind this is because people could move to a union job and make more money . this forced other businesses to compete , perhaps not to the same level but at least compete . as unions have shrunk in size and influence and as a result average wages have also . a minimum wage is a replacement for strong unions . it artificially creates a low , however morally in my opinion of course it should be a right . that a worker can earn a livable wage . you 'll notice states have their own higher minimum wage . states like oklahoma however do not . so a poor person in a rural area working at a mcdonalds , etc with very little in the way of education can have the opportunity to survive . until you 've needed to survive on minimum wage you do n't know how necessary it actually is . theory is a great thing until someone has to survive off of less . i own my own business . i 've owned 4 total . i 've never paid minimum wage , however i do n't employ nonskilled labor . businesses will be just fine with minimum wage , just the same as taxes . would you like to know why ? they operate on the same field . henry ford said when asked about the new income tax what he thought of it . his answer was so long as everyone has to pay it i 'll get ahead . in the richest nation in the world where the government subsidizes so many , the working poor should have a base by which they can gauge their income . i believe this recent minimum wage hike was the first in roughly 810 years or more in no way keeping up with inflation . supposedly minimum wages cause unemployment . well at 4 i do n't think we have much to worry about , in spite of the reckless mismanagement by the current administration . so to make it short , if your pathetic business can not afford to make money paying your help minimum wage , shut down . i have no sympathy . besides there is a massive group of nonminimum wage workers , illegal immigrants .	c03br25	Economics

how on earth would you enforce that ? how does the government enforce the fact that all medicine must be prescribed by someone with a 4 year md ? i certainly am not recommending we do this ! it scares me to even talk about it , lest someone get the wrong idea . my point is that softwarehardware is almost entirely unregulated , and the improvements in quality and affordability have been vastly greater than that in the regulated industries . take your open source idea . presumably there would be some side effects of this . investing in software development would be far less profitable if competitors could just copy my code . open source is great , but it 's sweet spot is copying existing software and creating stuff that hackers like . it 's not so good at producing innovative business software . so how can you tell if the benefits of your policy outweigh the costs ? i sure as hell ca n't . you might be right , but i certainly have no way of calculating it . i work for a software startup . we 're all smart people , but it 's hard enough figuring out how to build , price , and market one product . no one is smart enough to manage the entire economy . that 's why it 's so important to let market forces work . as for the banking comment if you create a financial system where you have a lender of last resort that ultimately prints money and bails out bank , then you will absolutely need regulations to prevent banks from taking advantage of this . mises and rothbard were among the earliest to point this out . they also pointed out that no amount of regulation will ever be enough . companies can innovate faster than the government , and will figure out ways of getting around the regulations . eventually , their shenanigans will collapse , the lender of last resort will be forced to bail them out , and people will call for a new round of regulations . it never ends , until you nationalize the whole financial sector . this is exactly the process we are witnessing today . and that 's why mises and rothbard were so adamantly against the lender of last resort . companies should fail , and they should fail early and often , before they can bring down the whole economy .	c03plao	Economics

calling it a philosophical question does n't suggest that it can not be resolved by consensus . it has been resolved , and economics does n't meet the definition science 's definition is clear is it ? what is it ? the fact that you state that there is '' a consensus about what science is shows that you do n't really know a lot about epistemology . consensus amongst whom ? there is not even a consensus about what philosophy is ! your argument is that , if a particular result is needed but can not be acquired using the formal definition of science , then we move the goal posts redefine science to meet the conditions needed to acquire that particular result . almost my argument is that if a particular definition of science fails to provide an environment for insight into a specific matter , this definition of science is insufficient . if you insist you can say economic theory is not science . it is not science because the methodology is not as strict as in math or physics , and that 's the standard . that 's rethoric again , ok , a narrow definition of science as a methology set , instead of a wider definition as science as knowledge producing . i would agree , that both definitions are valid , both have advantages and disadvantages . that 's a matter of personal choice , i do n't want to convince you to use the one i prefer . what you ca n't say is that the discipline does not provide any understanding , any knowledge about the matter . because since economists are the ones looking into the matter , this would be like saying that there is no way of having any understanding about economics at all . all economics results that a are published and that b are a matter of concern to the public , produce a feedback effect and thus undermine themselves . this is the basis for the expression selffulfilling prophecy '' , and it prevents meaningful science . like the labour market data ? inflation ? what about my last post , the capital asset pricing model ? would n't you agree that it is a rather elegant model ? applicable , of course , only to the particular subject it deals with , as all models , but it provides insight , does n't it ? which is btw what was not understood by the author of your article the nature of a model . it reduces variables deliberately , such as the market system is a closed circular flow between production and consumption , with no inlets or outlets . no externalities unlimited growth these are dealt with in other models . demanding that a model should include everything would be like demanding a 11 map not useful at all .	c0m6bwo	Economics

not if you do n't receive any of the new inflation through an increased income absolutely false . i come out ahead regardless of whether my salary is inflation adjusted . this can be illustrated through simple math if i finance a 150k house today for 20 years at 4.5 , i pay 77754.41 in interest . so in 2030 i will have paid 227,754.41 for my 150k house . note that this is true regardless of whether or not there is inflation . if inflation between now and 2030 is 0 , that additional 77k goes up in smoke . but if inflation is 5 , in 2030 my 150k 2010 dollars house is now worth 237,583.20 . in other words inflation made my house worth 10k more than i paid for it , and approximately 87k more than it would have been worth had there been no inflation at all . note that my income during that 20 year period has no bearing on the above figures . your mortgage is fucking irrelevant because that is a fixed cost to you . i thought you said inflation made my debt worse . now you say it 's fucking irrelevant ? '' can you make up your mind ? if i am financing any debt whatsoever , i am far worse off under a no inflation scenario than under an inflationary scenario . that is , if there is no inflation and i continue making my mortgage payments , the 77k i pay in interest can not be recouped . but under an inflationary scenario i am paid back my interest and then some in 2030 when my house is worth more than i paid for it . while you are making 50,000 a year on a fixed income , consumer prices are rising 5 a year , meaning your fixed income will buy 5 less each and every year . but my debt payments are fixed . so whether my income buys less is irrelevant i 'm still paying the same amount in nominal terms to the bank every year . the only difference is that , under a noinflation scenario , the money i pay to the bank is worth more than under an inflationary scenario . that means the opportunity cost of my debt payments is actually higher if there is no inflation . remember if you 're going to claim that inflation makes debt worse '' you have to compare the cost of debt under an inflationary scenario to the cost of debt under a noinflation scenario , sageadvice . you did n't do that in your last post , but i 'll give you a second chance . ok , go .	c0icb3b	Economics

the argument that i have heard from austrians is that since you are lending the same money over and over again that constitutes fraud . if you own a furniture shop , and you only have one chair , you ca n't sell that same chair to 10 customers . i do n't know what bank you may be a customer of , but if you and all of the customers went in tomorrow to get your cash out , it would n't be there . banks have almost none of our money . this should disturb all of us ! krugman and others defend this system saying that banks have insurance . ok , but insurance is a similar system . they too do n't have enough to cover all or even most deposits should there be a run . and that 's where the lender of last resort '' comes in . oh sure , they give it a nice alphabet soup name like fdic which is close to being out of money by the way or something so official sounding like the federal reserve . but in the end , who is really on the line ? you and me , the tax payers ! we are the lender of last resort . so to sum up our banking system ... it is completely based on debt . money is created from debt . banks take our money and not only lend it out , but lend it out over and over again . if all of us were to go in to our banks to get the money it 's not there . the insurance covering it ca n't give us our money either . only the government can , but we fund the government . the banks are getting filthy rich by lending out money that they do n't have , and if they mess up ultimately we pay for it . is this really a system that we should stand behind ?	c2qhhtk	Economics

yes , the bank borrows the money after the fact usually from other banks . eventually though , all of the banks are tapped out ... all banks are tapped out ! there 's a brave assumption . anyhow ... and you have to go to the fed where the money is literally just created . the fed loans on the same terms as the banks in the interbank market against assets . if a bank does n't have assets available to sell or use as security for a loan , the fed wo n't lend it squat . then the bank is bankrupt . it gets taken over by another bank that assumes its debts , or plain goes out of business . its investors lose their investments in it . happens all the time . just like when any other business goes bankrupt . if the govt ponies up any money to close it , it comes from the fdic for insured deposits , from treasury or wherever i.e. , from taxpayers . tax money does not come from nothing , taxpayers are something . are you seriously arguing that all banks can pay back 100 of their deposits at any time , immediately ? any business that is solvent with assets exceeding liabilties can meet 100 of its liabilities by borrowing against or selling its assets . why do you imagine a bank ca n't ? a sovlent bank , in the worst extreme case , will call up the fed which will send over a truck of as much money as needed . that 's a loan from the fed to the bank , against the bank 's assets . it can happen in one day , sure , why not ? and it has happened , rarely . if there is no creation of money at any time , dude , how many times do i have to say that money is created , it just is not created from nothing ? banks create money all the time in the form of deposits but deposits are not nothing , banks have to attract depositors to get them , which is why banks give away toasters . the fed creates money all the time by buying or lending against financial assets . but financial assets are not nothing . if a bank has a 10,000 bond the fed may create 10,000 of money by buying the bond and giving the bank 10,000 of money in exchange for the bond , or lending the bank 10,000 of money against the bond . but that bond is not nothing '' . the fed ai n't creating money and giving it away to anybody for nothing just forget that . the banking system and the fed create money constantly but not out of nothing '' just because they are in the mood to do it . if a bank could create money out of literally nothing whenever it wanted to , i 'd damn well be a banker making money and giving it to me . and my bank could never go broke !	c2nyawm	Economics

it would not stop a monopoly . i am assuming that you mean a libertarian '' economy to mean an economy that is based only on perfectly competitive free markets . a libertarian '' economy assumes that the number of firms approaches infinity perfect competition where firms have no market power price takers . thus , if a monopoly or even an oligopoly exist in the first place then the assumptions of their model have been violated , and their conclusions are no longer valid . its more realistic to consider markets that are supplied by oligopolies a few firms , but this math tends to be too hard for undergraduate econ majors . hence , the tendency to have tons of halfeducated econ students who only know optimality conditions that apply to perfect competition that is the ideal of mainstream libertarians . i am convinced that micro level undergraduate economics courses at public universities are the main contributors to the growth of libertarianism and the misunderstanding of its shortcomings .	c1kwy2f	Economics

well , there are just so many ways to analyze risk and what that means , and looking into the future you 're always talking about most likely or more likely scenarios , and there are just so many assumptions involved . it is a huge part of what actuaries , do , of course , but you have to be careful of falling into the trap of assuming your model is reality '' instead of a close picture of reality '' . i think the hope is certainly that the lower income risk profile is mitigated a bit post 2014. i know that as of right now , a gap does exist , but quantifying it on the group level is almost impossible . looking in aggregate tells a much clearer picture , and i do n't have the data on hand or anything , but i know there are clear 10 20 differences in terms of loss ratios on those groups though that is n't a 100 accurate measurement as those groups probably pay a little more for their insurance , which makes their loss ratio look '' better . i know a good deal more data just about the split in risk between the worst 29ths and the healthiest 29ths , and what actuaries are projecting that looks like post 2014. for example , one thing people are n't entirely aware of is that underwriting is going away entirely in small group and individual insurance . not just denial due to preexisting conditions , but differences in premium setting due to health status ends . what this means is that a healthy groups will have an incentive to leave the risk pool when their underwriting goes away and they receive 15 35 rate increases depending on underwriting regs in the given state due simply to that component of the law all else equal , no adjustment for typical claims trends , etc . etc . , and b those healthy groups will have to more fully subsidize the care of the sickest since we can no longer rate up the sickest groups the 15 35 due to their health status . so , post 2014 , most projections indicate that the sickest 29ths segment of the risk pool will always lose money for the insurer to hold . since we ca n't underwrite them , there is just no way to make up the delta between their claims costs and their premium rates . the only way to do so is redistribute premiums rates and hit that healthy segment with the biggest increases . i guess i got off on a tangent there a bit , but it is a concern adverse selection that goes along with the mandate being relatively weak compared to the cost of insurance . i will be interested to see what happens to the claims delta when the sickest individuals have access to care . unfortunately , it is n't those annual check ups that really hit the hardest , it is those catastrophic illnesses and long term issues that really drive claims costs . if we can mitigate that , then great , we will see huge changes to the current trend climate . if what winds up happening is insurers have an influx of sick risk due to no more denial for preexisting , along with the pent up demandflood into the market without appropriate use of preventive benefits to offset those costs , then that would be a very bad thing for the health insurance market in the us and the health care system in general .	c6src2p	Economics

it simply reduces competition which increases prices and lowers quality . lol , no it does n't , not when you have a situation with a natural monopoly . learn some economics . natural monopolies have extremely high capital costs and only 1 provider is able to profitably give everyone service . people died when competition was introduced for water service historical example such a process happened in the water industry in nineteenth century britain . up until the midnineteenth century , parliament discouraged municipal involvement in water supply in 1851 , private companies had 60 of the market . competition amongst the companies in larger industrial towns lowered profit margins , as companies were less able to charge a sufficient price for installation of networks in new areas . in areas with direct competition with two sets of mains , usually at the edge of companies ' territories , profit margins were lowest of all . such situations resulted in higher costs and lower efficiency , as two networks , neither used to capacity , were used . with a limited number of households that could afford their services , expansion of networks slowed , and many companies were barely profitable . with a lack of water and sanitation claiming thousands of lives in periodic epidemics , municipalisation proceeded rapidly after 1860 , and municipalities were able to raise finance for investment , which private companies often could not . a few wellrun private companies that worked together with local towns and cities gaining legal monopolies and thereby the financial security to invest as required did survive , providing around 20 of the population with water even today . the rest of the water industry in england and wales was reprivatised in the form of 10 regional monopolies in 1989 .

but goldman sachs is a huge , complicated company , and i think it probably has people both buying and selling every financial instrument on earth at any given time . i 'm sure its boilerplate disclosures say that . certainly , when companies put out analyst disclosures , they say they might do everything possible with everything . the people who issued bad mortgages with obviously inaccurate info committed true crimes . everybody else just committed the crime of not understanding how rickety the system was . i studied this in school , around 1990 , and thought the system was stupid and doomed to come crashing down much sooner than it did , but the professors and industry participants who came to explain the system to us clearly believed it was wonderful and safe . they really thought they were getting rich by doing good , by helping regular people get credit . the problem is n't that they 're not being criminally prosecuted . they generally were n't trying to defraud anyone . the problem is that they were bailed out in a way that left them rich . i think geithner bailed them out because he was scared of the system collapsing , not intentionally to reward friends , but the result is that people who guessed wrong are rich and have homes that are still overpriced . i guessed completely right and never had any debt , but i still ca n't buy a home , because home prices are still too high and the credit scoring system somehow makes little nodebt , paymybills me look worse than a lot of highflying deadbeats . the moral geithner taught me and , to be honest , i knew this is how it would work is that i should have been a deadbeat when everyone else was . there are usually actually a lot of advantages to being a deadbeat lemming .	c3xb8ux	Economics

what you 're describing there is a collapse of all lending in jpy . that housing mortgages and business loans are all going up , that the boj is no longer able to ensure that banks are lending to each other at 0 interest etc . bond yields are going up , but so is everything else . your explanation for how this hypothetical has happened is because everyone is getting better returns on fx markets against the continual decline of the jpy than they would if they lent to each another . that fx markets are proving a safer investment than anything you can do with yen , and so safe yendenominated investments such as bonds are returning a bit more than the return everyone 's making on fx markets . the thing is though , fx markets do not create yen , the only yen you 're able to retract at a later date is the yen others are putting in . so this requires a continual net injection of yen to the fx markets for everyone to make a profit in this way , very ponziesque . additionally real prices of yendenominated exports must be rising , or else the yen would have reached a floor price ie it ca n't fall too far or yendenominated assetsexports simply become too attractive to foreigners . if prices are rising , the boj and the japanese government have reached their desired inflation target so why is the government continuing to run large deficits ? but yes , as i said before if there 's a collapse of all lending in yen ie brought about by very inflationary deficits , bonds will sell for a lower price ie higher yields . they 'll still go for the lowest interest rates attainable in yen over the duration of the bond though , regardless of where the government 's debt position was at . that was my critique earlier , many seem to think that government bond yields can spike '' independent of a currency crash . they can not . where the bonds are denominated in the freefloating currency the government issues . also you 'll note that mexican and argentian pesos were pegged . with a peg people can move money out without others having to move in . when you 're on a floating exchange rate , this can not occur . for you to move out , the price must be such that others are willing to move in . this makes a world of difference . the former , everyone can make profits by moving out , at least until the peg is moved usually due to the central bank running out of fx reserves . the latter , it 's similar to a ponzi scheme you can only make profits moving out of yen and then back in at a later date only if there 's people later to the game trying to do the same thing . eventually , people ca n't make profits that way anymore the moment the yen inflow to fx markets dries up , no more profits are attainable and some may accrue losses , if fx was a bubble . so unlike bonds , i do n't believe foreign currencies are ever going to be completely safe yendenominated investments '' . i believe this to be why the boj is having no difficulty keeping interest rates at zero today , bonds and interbank lending is still seen as a safer investment than the fx markets .	c9c4fss	Economics

ok , the symptom is that the top is hogging all of the fruits of our labors that does not follow . wealth can be created and destroyed it does not just flow . the argument was that by lowering taxes , we can run a balanced budget by taking a smaller slice of a bigger pie we hav n't balanced the budget in 30 years , and this social experiment is not giving us superior growth . tax the rich , its just that simple . thats not violence , thats fiscal responsibility . so you 're saying that people are n't doing what is proposed , and that 's an argument that it is n't working so we should do something else ? it 's only fiscal responsibility in the same sense you ran up your credit card bill and then force someone else to pay for it is fiscally responsible . can you understand that the cost of living is objectively determined ? it doesnt factor in cable or a smart phone or anything else that you imagine poor people feel entitled to . except reducing the cost of living means poor people are more likely to be able to afford luxuries like cable and a smart phone . where is the problem here ? oh , so now we need to get rid of the jobs ? i thought your position was that a higher minimum wage would destroy these jobs ? newsflash , if walmart didnt need these people , they would n't have hired them in the first place . newsflash labor is n't infinitely fungible . you 'll just incentivize hiring fewer , more productive peoplelike costco doeswhich means fewer jobs , or incentivize more automation , which will also destroy those jobs . just because the need of healthcare is encountered sporadically does n't mean that need is n't genuine or that people do n't need it every day . can you get any more sheltered ? i hav n't gotten sick yet , so ill never get sick '' , grow up kid . whenever the market fails to carry out this task , government aka the taxpayer , aka me , gets stuck with the tab . right because insurance for every other kind of disaster does n't exist and ca n't work ? do n't you think its a bit odd though , that you have been trained to take the position that wages should flow from the government and not the employer , yet you volunteer that employers should foot the bill for healthcare and not the government . i do n't take the position that wages should flow from the government and not the employer . last i checked i said to have less welfare , not more . yes , hence my argument for raising the minimum wage . you ... do n't understand my argument then . taking away the very market element that is taking pressure off higher wages is the solution . price controls , like the minimum wage do one of two things they either meet the equilibrium price , making them superfluous , or they do n't , creating a shortage of goods or customers . paying artificially high wages does not help the poor or the economy , and the value of labor is not based solely on the needs and wants of those selling it . no it does n't , working people still have no leverage . businesses need to pay the costs of the resources that they consume . they want an educated workforce ? they pony up for that . they want people to live near them for the purpose of working for them ? thats housing and transportation right there . they want people to exert calories of energy on their behalf ? those calories must be consumed . things cost money , your position that people should work at a loss is n't just entitled , it is also insanely irrational . yes , we do have the legal authority to enforce a reasonable living wage , deal with it . ah but you think that it 's perfectly okay to mandate businesses operate at a loss . you think people deserve '' jobs and the resources of others regardless of the value of their labor , and have the temerity to call detractors entitled in a spiraling dervish of cognitive dissonance . oh yeah , the same sort of word of mouth that gave us housing prices never go down '' . and reviews are always accurate , unbiased , useful and are never , ever written up by a sock puppet guess what no investment is guaranteed , and guess what even the government gets it wrong sometimes . imperfections in the market is not an argument for imperfect government intervention . you are arguing that we need to have a low minimum wage to stave off automation . that anecdote points out how stupid that position is . i see you have a fundamental misunderstanding about marginal productivity and its relevance in both that anecdote and the role its plays with respect to the minimum wage and automation . im talking amongst businesses , you know the entities that exist explicitly to be productive in meeting societies needs ? if you want to do business in town , you 're going to contribute to the road fund , period . they exist to meet societies wants by the services and goods they provide by conducting business with people . according to you , the grocer efficiently providing and storing food for you to affordably buy is n't enough . no , you bought their food and you both benefited from the transaction , but now you think you are entitled to a chunk of the money you paid them . besides , you can fund all roads with current gas , alcohol , and tobacco excise taxes . now justify the rest of taxes , or you 're just invoking the fallacy of composition . that individual people get old and can no longer work is irrelevant . the retired are not the only net tax recipients . what else do you call it when functions of government are privatized ? the private market ... have you really not reconciled what private property means in that context ? closed to the public '' ring any bells ? oh you mean like public '' property like city hall ? i 'm a citizen but i ca n't use it any time i want . quick question why do you think you 're entitled to others ' property ?	cktihgh	Economics

no longer crawling i recently noted that the evolution of emergingmarket exchange rate regimes since the crises of the 1990s helped explain their relative robustness in the face of recent market turmoil . but i said that fewer economies were using hard currency pegs , which is n't exactly right , as a new chart from the imf 's world economic outlook makes clear . in fact , the number of economies using hardcurrency pegs has actually gone up a bit over time . and free floating , which peaked right before the global recession , has lately gone out of fashion . but the big shifts , as it turns out , are in the hybrid exchangerate regimes . in particular , there has been a broad move away from crawling pegs and toward managed floats . that represents a net move toward more liberalised exchange rates , but it 's not the same thing as a general move to floating . the attraction of a managed float relative to a crawling peg is clear . the crawling peg is neither fish nor fowl it provides enough certainty for markets to build up vulnerability to a devaluation , while at the same time undermining the credibility of the peg by acknowledging that it may move amid big capital flows . a managed float , by contrast , generally frees the government from the need to defend any particular level of the currency . and pushing against appreciation enables the accumulation of foreignexchange reserves , which can then be deployed to ease depreciation when market sentiment shifts . of course , and as the imf points out , a free floating regime has been associated with the lowest probability of crisis over the past generation . but for emerging economies unwilling to take that plunge which occasionally means taking that plunge the managed float looks a good bit more attractive than other regime options .	ciud1uc	Economics

sounds like you 're suggesting that the government can turn a bad investment into a good one just by nature of their being the one investing . if there 's an indeterminable but undoubtedly high risk associated with a venture , how is the nature of this risk somehow changed by the government stepping in to absorb said risk ? its a gamble either way , and money lost to a gamble is still money that could have gone somewhere else . if the government investment fails to produce returns , its still a loss , and that loss was just as likely for the government as the private sector , no ? only in one case the only person harmed is the investors while in the other everyone is harmed . so why would we be okay with the government taking risks on our behalf that we ourselves would not be okay taking ? especially since the government has less reason to be directly concerned with the return on investment since its not their money they 're spending . this is not to say that i 'm disagreeing that once a government takes the first step to demonstrating the risks then the private sector can choose to followupstay far away based on the results , but i simply do n't see why the government is 'better ' at taking that first step since it has the exact same information as everyone else . seems to me that a risk that is too large for the private sector should be avoided until the private sector is willing to take said risk , and let them spend their money on less risky things until that point .	clq2lzg	Economics

beyond housing , the results in this paper if anything tentatively suggest that concern about inequality should be shifted away from the split between capital and labor , and toward other aspects of distribution , such as the withinlabor distribution of income this , by the way , suggests the blame lies not within the split between capital and labor , but to place the blame on labor itself and its inability to distribute income properly within itself . in other words , blame the poor . that 's why this student 's paper is starting to receive acclaim .	cpsunss	Economics

that is the beauty of the eitc . you must work in order to earn the tax income . if you do not work , you do not earn it . therefore it is an incentive to enter the labor force but does n't it also incentivize employers to offer lower wages ? if you give people government money just for having a job , then they will accept jobs at lower wages than they would otherwise be willing to . if people are willing to accept jobs at lower wages than they would otherwise , then employers will offer lower wages . the credit will end up distributed between employers and workers in proportion to the relative elasticities of demand and supply . or at least , that 's my econ101level take on the subject .	crhv455	Economics

i think the thing you overlook in your analysis '' of this situation is that these jobs that we 're talking about operating at minimum wage are not jobs that are for those looking to support a family and children . serving fast food and stocking shelves at walmart are not jobs that people should be working at if they need to support a family . the economics is fucked up because of this idea that every job that is available should serve to provide food , shelter and vacation pay for every single person that has one . what about those with 0 experience . kids in school . people needing supplemental incomes willing to work for whatever . the fact that government provides these extravagant packages to people is more the problem than low wages . does the income from those low wage workers get taxed enough for these welfare programs to break even ? why are able men working at these minimum wage jobs trying to support families ? why are all the high paying jobs not available for them ? i 100 understand what you 're saying ... but you 're incorrect in your thinking because you 're essentially saying that if i open a lemonade stand and hire the neighbor kid to work there that kid should get paid a wage they could use to support a family on but since they ca n't the government then has to subsidize my lemonaid stand so that i can pay them lower wages and the government checks make up the difference . i 'm sorry but your logic is flawed and it 's not your fault the entire society is setup so that the greater population believes in this manner so that the root of the problem is n't focused on and only symptoms of the much larger problem are attacked . the value of our money is being debased , eroded and inflated to nothingness yet we talk about symptoms and effects of this in a vacuum .	cqy3asa	Economics

this is what happens when you ascribe entities the rights of people without the duties and obligations and bindings of the social contract . i 'm obligated not to fuck up my neighbor 's back yard . but corporations have fucked up entire regions of the planet and then they grease a few palms and walk away with all their illgotten gains . what other person '' is only responsible to own interests at the expense of all others ? if corporations are people then bp and pretty much every other petroleum company should have gotten the death penalty . the porter ranch gas leak URL poisoned thousands and caused them to evacuate their homes for weeks . amazingly , even under the heightened surveillance during the socalgas leak , another gas well operator , the termo company , had gone ahead and detached a pipeline . the effort was brazen , authorities said . if it wasn t for the aerial surveillance , the illegal discharge could have continued indefinitely , doggr supervisor ken harris said in a statement . someone clearly made an effort to conceal the pipe , because even though we knew from aerial readings where it was generally , our field staff had to search carefully before finding it behind a tree. i have a degree in petroleum engineering , although i have never worked in the industry . i asked some people in the oilandgasjobs forum about that pipeline disconnect being hidden like that . their response ? does n't surprise me sketchy shit worse than that goes on all the time in the field . '' if that 's the case , then the industry needs to be hammered because the wildcatter mentality still reigns and safety or responsibility is n't remotely on their minds . unfortunately , our government does n't tax the industry adequately to pay for the safety inspectors it needs and so the industry does what it pleases at the expense of us all .	e4b5c4r	Economics

you did n't prove anything wrong . you cited a source that said campaign contributions were n't tax deductible . that does n't matter . it 's still an expense for the company whether it for lobbying , pacs , think tanks , direct contributions , positions on the board , speaking engagements , or numerous other ways to support a contribution . even if these contributions came out of profit , it would n't matter that the margins are low for an industry as massive as health insurance . finding enough money to contribute to a handful of political campaigns is easy with a 2 margin on a product sold to millions of people .	dsjep5z	Economics
because to the economy , they are . so . if i demolish my property then the economy does n't suffer ? similarly , if all properties were demolished then the economy would not suffer ? i do n't agree . the property i own provides a service to my tenants . they pay me for providing that service . so , it is an asset , not a liability . it is an asset to society at large , just as it is to me . the structure of society i.e . who pays who is irrelevant . i said its non productive . something that produces a service is still productive . a hairdresser can cut your hair , that 's a service . that means a hairdresser is productive . if a hairdresser is productive then so is a house . similarly , if a house is n't productive then neither is a hairdresser . no , they are forced to pay you rent by the state . of course not . they do n't have to live in my house , or in any house . they could sleep under the stars if they wanted to . you may just mean that the state enforces my property rights . it allows me to evict those who do n't pay . that 's true ofcourse .	ds8fwxe	Economics
gm 's problems are obvious fallout from the tariffs . the size of the hit took me by surprise , and maybe the market felt the same way . it 's bad , and either the ploy to get other countries to drop their tariffs works or it fails and things do n't improve . it 's a lovely game of chicken with people 's livelihoods and industries at stake . likewise , agri 's ability to sell this year was also foreseeable , and insurance companies will take the hit before the farmers , but that should be a onetime hit as they adjust for 2019. the biggest reason this hurts the market is that it 's new territory and there 's nothing like uncertainty to break a bear 's back .	ecadcan	Economics
life is speeding up . people who won t retrain and continue training will get left behind . the world used to be less competitive when the us was the only major power . the old middle class in the us is bitter they re becoming poor , but the wealth they feel entitled to went toward lifting the entire world out of poverty . there is still more opportunity here than anywhere else , we re still the global 1 , but as they say equality feels like discrimination when your used to special treatment this shouldn t be a big surprise . when i was in high school in the late 90s every knew computers and china were the future and the nerds would get everything . this has been the slowest and most manageable train wreck of all time . you can still get off ! here s some good general advice that will always be true . if you don t get the most demanded skills the market seeks , you will be compensated with less wealth in the future for your efforts . you ll still get giant tvs and cell phones or whatever , but you ll have to make stuff last longer and don t be surprised if the people doing what society needs get to send their kids to better schools than the rest of us who feel entitled to love randomly	e0xk86v	Economics

i do n't feel more confident after reading this report . it basically straight up says we need universal healthcare and either a ubi or subsidies for employers to retrain workers . it does not suggest given the current regulatory enviroment that the middle class will recover , but continue to hollow . the report does not fully grasp the nature of the automation coming . this just assumes basic automation , it does n't even begin to touch on automation that verges on ai , which would put pressure on the kinds of positions they suggest many to move into . in addition it 's troubling that they suggest new jobs will be created , but nowhere in the report did the numbers suggest job creation that would replace jobs losses . the report seems to indicate we 're all going to be artists , programers , healthcare workers or personal servers to affluent consumers .

wages have not been stagnant for starters . large companies haven t depressed wages either , joes pizza shop is almost certainly paying less than amazon warehouse employees and doesn t provide healthcare either . do you think small companies are able to develop drugs or navigate the myriad regulatory issues enacted by the .gov ? don t we all pay for the roads via gas taxes ? if they have no local presence how is amazon even using public transit or electrical infrastructure also paid for by users anyway . amazon pays 15hr double the minimum wage . what do you think they should be paying ? they re already paying 2x what the local guy is . the issue with housing prices is the government is prohibiting developers from building enough housing . tokyo doesn t have the same affordability issues we do because they actually allow housing to be developed . cities offer tax breaks to companies relocating because if that company didn t relocate , the locality would never receive a dime from them . if the cities think they can attract companies without the breaks they should remove them .	efenwvi	Economics
