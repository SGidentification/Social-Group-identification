they wo n't fight forever , but yes , they would very much like their land back . why the land was taken is complicated . the land was already occupied by foreign powers when given to the israelis . each side has its own agenda , and more than two sides are really at war . the land has strong ties to religion , economy , race , politics , trade , culture , and agriculture . many empires have owned the land throughout history . the arabs forces do n't even really have control of land they already have , so it seems painfully unrealistic that they could ever have israel .	5fcd	worldpolitics

the intellectual neocons who control policy in the us have conned much of the general public to believe that questioning authority is unpatriotic . the propaganda has been so effective that the masses frequently equate intellectualism with antipatriotism , and patriotism with antiintellectualism . this has been accomplished in a number of ways . fox news '' has perhaps been the most successful at whipping up the masses to gullibly swallow wholesale partisan bias without question . to question is to be labeled enemy . by successfully exploiting wedge issues , thoughtful nuance is swept aside in favor of blind brand allegiance . in the constant barrage that is the 247 news cycle , everything is distilled into easily memorized sound bites with no room for subtle distinctions or contemplative thought . you 're either for us , or against us . '' i 'm the decider . '' none of this would be possible if our schools encouraged critical thinking . but , whether through virtue of being overburdened and underfunded , or whether by virtue of calculating design to insure an uninformed workforce , critical thinking is n't really even tolerated in most schools until at least the undergraduate level , if even then .	c062ie1	worldpolitics

ok , let 's pick a different comparison then . cuba . we 've had embargoes on the country for decades now . if cuba fired a freaking pop rocket in the general direction of the united states back in the 70 's , we would have had global thermonuclear war . the soviet union was funneling money into the country just as egypt and saudi arabia are into gaza . cuba had some pretty bad humanitarian crises from lack of food directly related to the united states embargo . thank god they choose to go the route of peace ... yet still we punish them ! i know i 'm going to get downmodded to hell for this , but frankly both sides need to sit the fuck down and cool off . if hamas was n't so petulant in their adament declaration of instability , we would n't have this mess . and if israel was n't so callous about the humanitarian perspective , we would n't be condemning them . however , in this specific case , hamas is going too far . given their violent tendencies , even if palestine and israel forged a relationship as amenable as the united states and mexico , it seems like to me that they 'd still be firing rockets into israel . this is unacceptable , and we need to spread the condemnation around . edit yeah , i realize that the soviets in this case started it first '' by shipping missiles into cuba prior to the embargo . the eventual stalemate was similar though .	c076cc9	worldpolitics

amnesty international made a lot of mistakes in compiling that report , though . they did n't consult with the israel water authority to verify any figures , ask about works in progress , or progress already made on the issue . and let me tell you , the palestinians are already receiving a greater share of the water from the mountain aquifer that they 're using than they are entitled to under the oslo accords i think that 's the right treaty . water is scarce all over the middle east right now , and the palestinians are living at or above daily average water consumption in a lot of nearby arab capital cities amman for sure . to be sure , there 's a gap between the israelis and palestinians in terms of daily average water consumption . but ai calls it 300 l to 70 l. iwa gives a different figure , which it says is more accurate , is more like 400 l to 200 l. it makes a huge difference , since the who says healthy living requires 100 l if you really believe they 're only getting 70 l of water each per day , you should be perturbed . however , i think the iwa tracks water meticulously and has an infrastructure specifically designed to do so . which ai did n't even investigate if they had , i 'd see their numbers as more credible , especially if they had been able to point out instances of overreporting of water given to palestinians . but they did n't . a friend of mine works for the west bank civil administration . he 's full of stories about projects stuck in the pipeline so to speak because they ca n't secure funding from the pa for this critical infrastructural investment . and i do believe that israel shares responsibility for that institution building , but i do n't think israel is totally at fault for the pa 's failure to prioritize the welfare of their own people . you ca n't make life miserable for yourself and then blame israel . at least not in terms of water . and , israel does n't destroy wells or cisterns , to my knowledge .	c0ezwsi	worldpolitics

well they would n't really have a choice if they really want to attack lebanon . also , israel and syria are still at war , so neither side really needs an excuse , though syria would have a good one if it comes to the aid of lebanon in the event of an israeli attack . uh yes they really do . both sides would be screwed in their own ways in the event of war . it really depends on what syria tries to do . if they take a defensive strategy and just bombard israel like lebanon and hezballah would do , then they might not do so poorly . if they try and attack and take back the golan heights , then they would n't do so well , no . syria has a conventional military . israel has a much more technologically advanced conventional military . hezbollah is a fairly unique organization . they 're good at what they do and syria , an actual country with a conventional military ca n't replicate hezbollah 's tactics . i highly doubt they 'd be dumb enough to use those . they would just be asking to get nuked by israel . maybe if israel nukes them first , then they would possibly use them , but i doubt they 'd shoot themselves in the foot like that . keep in mind in this scenario there is a full scale war going on between syria and israel . i really do n't think so . if they wanted to get the us to go first then they would n't be doing monumentally stupid political moves , like snubbing the us vice president to his face . they have nothing but disdain for america despite everything they do for them . they want to attack iran and will do so , but it seems like they want to make sure they can drag the us into it when they do . i really do . israel has a very , very limited offensive capability at such a distance and would not be able to do all that much to iran and the backlash greater sympathy in the world for iran 's nuclear program and greater isolation for israel to name two would make things worse . of course they have nothing but disdain for america despite everything they do for them . that 's why israeli leadership is doing everything in their power to make america attack iran . what 's your basis for thinking either of those things ? i already mentioned 1 syria would lose a conventional war and 2 israel would suffer a heavy toll despite winning such a war which would accelerate the movement of secular jews outside israel .	c0wqr49	worldpolitics

ok so you 're saying that it should be a 'jewish ' state because it has a single cultural and ethnic identity within it 's borders whatever they may be . but like i said earlier , this is simply not the case . there is a large minority of arabs with their own cultural and ethnic identity within israel . in fact , this wasis the problem . israel knows that to be able to define itself as a 'jewish nation state ' , the arab population needs to be marginalized . to do this you can expel the arabs , or you can immigrate to the area . israel has done both . i do n't think there is any debate here . and anyways , even if israel was a nation state , that does n't mean it 's not morally reprehensible to create laws that favor one ethnicity over another . do any other nation states have laws that favor one ethnicity over another ? i did n't see any from the examples in your reading material .	c12bmv1	worldpolitics

all parties agreed to keep the first article of the current constitution which says tunisia s language is arabic and its religion is islam . this is just a description of reality , ghannouchi said . it doesn t have any legal implications . URL hc what do you make of israel 's demand that it should be recognised as an exclusively jewish state ? as someone who is jewish yourself do you support that demand ? sh that demand is really what allows us to say that what happens there is similar to apartheid because when there is one part which claims to be something that the others can not be , and the others can not be jewish , then therefore this jewish state is a little bit like the whites here during apartheid south africa saying , we are the ones '' we the jews '' or we the whites '' and the others have to be disregarded . so that is why we feel that there is a similarity between what is happening to the palestinians and south african apartheid and we are trying to show that in our statements . URL so to conclude when tunisia wants to make a description of reality no outcry . when israel wants to make a description of reality it 's racism , apartheid etc . perhaps those who agree with these false accusations against israel think no atheists exist in israel ? no arabs exist in israel ? that no nonmuslims live in tunisia ? that no nonarabic speaking people live in tunisia ? is the statement of tunisias official language racist against those immigrants who ca n't speak arabic ? are they racist against nonarabs ? of course the statements of tunisia is not racist and neither are those of israel saying they are a jewish state . it 's simply a description of reality .	c2zcjqv	worldpolitics

the differences in how we treat murderers centers on intent , yes . we are suffering from this fiction perpetrated by our leaders that says that war is okay because they 're not intending to kill innocents . they 're not targeting innocents , and so when innocents die , it 's okay you see , because we did n't mean to kill them . we started the war knowing full well that innocents will die , of course . we knew damn well that many people would be losing their lives . but when we dropped this bomb or razed this village or cratered this power plant it was n't our intention at that time to kill the people we killed . and so it 's all okay . that 's what they want us to believe . i would suggest to you that the holocaust is a tool that is used to cement the above logic in our minds . it 's a way of rehabilitating war . the effort to create categories by which killing is to be judged is precisely about reserving unto the people who want to kill the right to do same . oh sure , it was terrible that we cratered that city , but we did n't target civilians , and so it 's okay . they 're bad because they target civilians . they 're bad because they target civilians and we 're good because we do n't , even though when we go to war we kill way more civilians than they do . but it 's okay , because it 's war . this is the bullshit that gets us all killed .	ccrgnwp	worldpolitics

well the 'facts ' in this matter is that regardless of who is or is n't semitic now , back when the phrase was coined by 19th century europeans the only semitic people in europe , and the only people this particular brand of persecution could apply to were jews , who at the time were regarded as an entirely different race to aryans for instance . the fact that obviously not all jews especially those who lived in europe are semitic at all , just illustrates the perversity of this phrase 's background . nonetheless , making the argument now that antisemitism is 'technically ' referring to people other than jews is to be wilfully ignorant of how that phrase came to be . or in short whatever a semite is , antisemitism is prejudice against jews . end of story . i fang yew .	c9vrya0	worldpolitics

us foreign policy explained it is very easy to understand current us foreign policy , providing you can get your head around some simple facts . the us , israel , saudi arabia , the gulf states and uk governments are all allies . their foreign policy is mutually beneficial . note it is beneficial to the rulers of those countries , not to the people who actually live in those countries . saudi arabia and the gulf states want to sell their oil and natural gas at a high price , preferably at around 100 a barrel . there is a glut of available oil at 100 a barrel . in order to keep the price of oil at about 100 a barrel the production and distribution of other countries oil has to be suppressed and limited . the main countries currently being or recently targeted to reduce their supplies of oil are iran , iraq , russia , libya the main countries currently being targeted to limit the distribution of natural gas are syria , ukraine note these are all war zones . russia and iran are cold wars , while the others are hot . having a war in a country is a great way of limiting it 's production of oil . the interests of the us government are served by this policy by increasing us military spending increasing the profits of us arms companies increasing the profits of large us and uk oil companies increasing the profits of large us and uk banks by supplying almost free money to them via the federal reserve . this can only continue if the us government continues to run extremely large deficits . the best way to have a large deficit is to spend money on war or arms . keeping americans and brits scared of a foreign enemy in order to pass and maintain draconian laws for domestic political control which are sold as counter terrorism measures . this tactic is as old as the hills . n.b . if the us government actually wanted to fight islamic terrorism as they publicly say they are , they would shut down the saudi terror networks wahhabi extremist schools . stop the flow of funds to islamic terror groups from saudi arabia and the gulf states , via nsa spying and the cia . stop recruiting islamic extremists via drone strikes and mindless interventions in the middle east . withdraw support for israel 's brutal ethnic cleansing and mass murder . etc . etc . etc . the interests of the israeli government are served by instability in the middle east keep the arabs and the middle east , fighting against themselves and not against israel . n.b . this also serves the interests of the rulers of saudi arabia and the gulf states by distracting their domestic populations from the actions of their own governments . keeping the flow of funds from the us to israel . keeping the levels of hate and conflict high between jews and arabs high for domestic political control . the last thing the likud party wants is for any peace to break out . the likud and netanyahu purely survive on maintaining a high level of hate , war and terrorism within israel and in the wider middle east . in order to pursue these policies a primary requirement for all these countries is to recruit more islamic terrorists than are killed , to keep their domestic populations scared and blinded by hate . hence we have things like the us drone warfare program and the israeli attack on gaza very deliberately targeting and killing high numbers of civilians , including women and children , to stoke up muslim anger around the world in order for the ranks of islamic terror groups to be expanded . we have things like the creation and funding of isis by saudi arabia and the cia with the express purpose of regime change in syria . we get things like the recent brutal and well publicized beheading of a us journalist by isis . there is nothing better than a bit of gratuitous barbarism to stoke up american anger against muslims . we have things like the war in mali and boku haram in nigeria . the oil producing countries in west africa like nigeria or algeria are a likely future target for us engineered instability and more war . a further requirement , in order to pursue these policies , is a very heavily controlled and censored press and main media . which is the case in all of these countries . after all having a high oil price and lots of wars and terrorism is not in the interests of the people who live in any of these countries . if people actually realized the truth of what 's going on they might get a bit upset . this article appears to hit the nail on the head to explain the recent events in syria , iraq and the actions of isis . you wo n't see it published in the media of any of these countries .

really ? you think that being polite to a police officer would end up with you getting your ass whooped just because he 's racist ? maybe a few cops have been that medieval in the past , but damn , i highly doubt that is happening . what i do see is a lot of arguing , talking back , not following the officer 's orders and then pulling the race card when they get tackled to the ground . are there cases of blatant racism where a police officer uses excuses to assault a man out of his legal jurisdiction ? yes , of course . that is the point of all of this , but a lot of these scenarios could be avoided if they were polite to the officer . all i can think of is how dumb it is to provoke someone who inherently hates you for who you are and has authority over you so you can prove some kind of point to yourself just to end up abused or thrown in jail . that baffles me . yes , i can understand being angry and losing control . that makes sense , especially if it happens daily . all i am saying is that you should try not to get angry with the police . use your anger against the police through proper channels like the aforementioned . not all police officers are racist , most are n't and are good people . hating the police because a few are racists is the same type of generalizations you hate to hear about any race . it 's hypocritical .	cjy9962	worldpolitics
this is an extremely poor economic analysis , i 'm disappointed to see that the author has a ph.d. at ucla . he should know better . there are so many confounding factors that make this analysis useless . for example , from the 40 's through to the 80 's , a large percentage of capital gains 50 could be excluded from taxation . this enabled business owners to more readily reinvest capital as the government was n't expropriating as much of it . the top marginal rate data the author used did not include the most important part the portion of inflation adjusted income that would be subject to the tax . as you can see here in the history of income tax rates ... '' table URL , the top marginal rate was only applied to the extremely wealthy incomes 1m million from 1913 through the early 1980 's . now , it is increasingly likely for middle class wealthy to get hit by top marginal rates , which will severely effect gdp growth as they are by and large the small business creators in this country . another thing which is harder to put on a graph is the massive growth of the size and scope of the federal government . the government is sucking up so much more capital now than it did during the period of high gdp growth . it 's no surprise to me that this negatively impacts growth . one final note the purpose of taxation policy is not to boost gdp growth , it is to fund the government . all citizens are created equal , and should be taxed equally and fairly . you raise the top marginal income tax rate to a catastrophic level like 65 which severely penalizes the responsible accumulation of wealth , people will leave the country and i likely would as well . look at how france has fared with their experimental 75 rate . it 's hurting the economy so bad even the socialists are starting to think it 's a bad idea .	cf5aa9h	worldpolitics

what if ... the wars were never about terrorism they were always about money and corporate greed what if ... what if it had already been decided to invade iraq soon after the possible invasion during the first gulf war was called off in 1991. what if dick cheney started working on plans to make this acceptable to public opinion soon after the first gulf war what if iraq had the 3rd largest oil reserves in the world . what if enough influential people could be signed up to support these plans due to various reasons . what if these plans were published in pnac the neocon agenda in 1997 what if saddam hussein called on the arab world to price oil in something other than dollars in 2000 what if the bankers could be persuaded to support this idea in order to protect the federal reserve system by keeping oil priced in dollars . what if the bankers could be persuaded to support this idea because it would mean the government borrowing more money and making them richer . what if the arms companies could be persuaded to support this idea because it would allow them to sell more arms . what if the oil companies could be persuaded to support this idea because it would increase the price of oil and they could grab iraq 's oil cheaply . what if israel 's supporters could be persuaded to support this idea because they thought it would remove a threat to israel . what if something major happened to get the majority of americans to support an invasion of iraq . what if it was deliberate policy to provoke islamic anger by having no post invasion plans and fewer troops than required in order to cause chaos and anarchy in iraq . what if it was decided to dismantle all existing iraqi government structures to further encourage factional infighting . what if iraqi prisoner abuse was deliberately encouraged to provoke more islamic and iraqi anger . what if basic utilities such as electricity were deliberately removed from the people . what if there was high unemployment to stoke up fury and resentment . what if iraq civil war was deliberate policy . what if the civil war was deliberately stoked up by the use of depleted uranium , white phosphorous and large numbers of civilian casualties . what if general islamic anger could further be stoked up by the use of torture , illegal kidnappings and indefinite detentions . what if the iraqi civil war went on long enough to destabilize the whole region . what if it was decided long ago that such a civil war in iraq would only be resolved by bribing local tribal leaders with billions of american tax dollars . what if the iraqi people got so fed up with the civil war that they would n't complain when iraq 's oil was sold to western oil companies for a pittance , as part of the peace deal . what if troop numbers in afghanistan were varied to get a never ending ebb and flow to the level of conflict in that country . what if the americans already knew that afghanistan had never been conquered since alexander the great and would not be conquered now . what if more islamic extremists could be recruited throughout the middle east by american actions in iraq and afghanistan . what if there were significant numbers of indiscriminate killings of civilians , especially women and children , to stoke up anger in the islamic world . what if drones could be developed to allow this to be the favored method of killing civilians with few witnesses outside of the local population and little news reaching the american public . what if a continuing afghan conflict could be used to encourage islamic extremist uprisings and regime changes in other middle eastern countries . what if the islamists mounting uprisings in other me countries were supported and protected by the american government to encourage more countries to do likewise . and so we are here the arms companies and defense '' contractors have had a decade of record profits . the big bank execs those in the know have got rich out of a decade of large government deficits and since 2009 , zero interest rate policies . the surviving american big banks have become even larger and more powerful as their weaker and less cogent rivals were taken over . the big western oil companies have got their deals for cheap iraqi oil as well as a decade of high oil prices . they too have had a decade of huge profits . the supporters of israel were deceived this was never going to help israel feel or be safer . making israel and america less safe encourages more arms purchases throughout the middle east and the world in general . it also encourages more american government deficits for the bankers to feed from , as well as the arms companies . money and profits for large corporations was always the sole motivation . it was never to make israelis or americans feel any safer or be any better off quite the reverse . the libyan secular regime has been replaced by an islamic extremist one , as has egypt . the islamic extremists , supported by the american government , are fighting to take over control in syria . lebanon and jordan have started to be destabilized by events in the region and the syrian civil war . yemen has it 's own civil war , with islamic extremists fighting to overthrow a corrupt puppet us sponsored regime . there is now a growing islamist movement in sub saharan africa , particularly in mali , and there is also local conflict in nigeria . this is the next excuse for continuing and expanding the wars . islamic extremists are still being recruited and anti american feelings encouraged , by a policy of deliberately killing civilians and terrorizing local populations with robotic weapons called drones . what happens next what the architects of this plan failed to take into account was the growing power of china and russia . it will be their undoing . china and russia can see as easily as i can what the americans have been doing . they can also see that america is much weaker now than it was a decade ago strategically , economically and is now debt laden . just like vietnam , america has demonstrated that it can not counter a guerilla war militarily . both the chinese and the russians have taken advantage of it . china by signing trade deals for half of africa 's natural resources and growing very fast economically by selling to american consumers on the back of huge inflation in the american money supply . russia by taking advantage of high oil and gas prices and by the disposal of any dissenting oligarchs who might threaten the current regime . the chinese and russians can see how weak america now is . they are now forming a non usd trading coalition with india , brazil , japan , australia , south africa , half of africa and possibly germany . the rest of se asia is forming closer trading ties with china . this trading bloc will be far larger in gdp terms , than either north america or the european union . the federal reserve banking system is now facing the biggest threat in it 's history . it is now threatened by china and russia . other countries are moving increasingly towards china 's trading bloc and away from america . events may run their course and america may suffer a dramatic economic collapse all on it 's own . or the chinese and russians may just have to give it a nudge when they are ready . a nudge is all that it will take . america is very vulnerable already . conclusions the so called war on terror '' was never about terrorists or terrorism . it was always about money , corporate greed and the power of elites . it will be their undoing , i do n't think the chinese and russians are going to play ball . the power of the federal reserve bank and the western private bankers that own it , is going to diminish with the loss of the dollar as the world 's reserve currency . american hegemony will be lost to a new chinese centered , south east asian hegemony . the american government wo n't have the resources to borrow much money or to buy many arms in the future . there will be an increase in tension between america and china over the coming years . it may become a hot war . there will be one final fling and one last throw of the dice in american military and government spending , the architects of the grand plan do not give up power easily . it will probably cost a lot of lives around the world , but this is immaterial to the money lenders . the architects of the grand plan , christened the war on terror '' have miscalculated this time . there is a million to one shot that the american government might completely reverse course and prevent the scenario above . there are no signs of it happening .	cmx22q4	worldpolitics
i believe the problem is that the word has morphed somewhat , and its newfound ambiguity is convenient for distasteful sorts on both sides . zionism obviously originally meant the belief that there ought to be a jewish nationstate , so that an antizionist was someone who believed a nationstate would be a colonial project unfit for the jewish people that would ultimately ethically compromise them the principled sort of antizionism in my opinion , the palestinian victims of that colonizing project who were essentially ethnically cleansed from their homeland owing to an ancestral claim 2,000 years out of date also quite principled , though it often assumes an ugly form , or mere antisemites significantly less so . but over time zionist '' has come to mean something rather more like supporter of and apologist for the israeli government , which is a pretty easy thing for even leftwing israelis to reject . so now we have all these various associations jumbling around the word , much to the detriment not only of clarity but also integrity of argument . after all , now the israeli government and its apologists can go around saying that anybody who 's an antizionist is an antisemite , which is clearly not the case meanwhile , actual antisemites can hide behind the antizionist cause and cast aspersion upon zionists '' when they really mean jews '' a taint upon what i believe to be an essentially noble cause . i think the creation of israel was from the start a mistake , for jews as much as for the arab palestinians they displaced , and while you certainly ca n't change the past and it 's here to stay , moving it culturally and politically away from being a rapacious ethnic nationstate on the european model and toward a pluralistic and democratic society would go a long way toward solving the region 's problems but of course to even think about that we 'd need to figure out a way to end the occupation , which is its own can of worms . and yes , before you bring it up i think america was a disgusting colonial experiment as well , built on the backs of slaves and vouchsafed by genocideethnic cleansingapartheid , and has only been redeemed somewhat since then by the spirit of rebellion among its oppressed classes which led to the little progress we 've made in the past century and a half and will hopefully one day culminate in something resembling the democracy we pretend to be . but i 'm a wacky socialist , so .	cj0jihb	worldpolitics

governments literally create false realities to keep people in conflict . that is so that populations remain fearful of each other and divided and do not unite to overthrow the elites . it is a part of a strategy of tension that has been employed for at least hundreds of years through governments and probably thousands of years through relgions . we are manipulated into this fear of one another . the following is a passage from howard zinn 's a people 's history ... '' black and white worked together , fraternized together . the very fact that laws had to be passed after a while to forbid such relations indicates the strength of that tendency . in 1661 a law was passed in virginia that in case any english servant shall run away in company of any negroes '' he would have to give special service for extra years to the master of the runaway negro . in 1691 , virginia provided for the banishment of any white man or woman being free who shall intermarry with a negro , mulatoo , or indian man or woman bond or free . '' from another section bacon 's rebellion brought together groups from the lower classes . white frontiersmen started the uprising because they were angry about the way the colony was being run . then white servants and black slaves joined the rebel lion . they were angry , toomostly about the huge gap between rich and poor in virginia . the greatest fear of wealthy southern planters was that black slaves and poor whites would combine in another uprising like bacon 's rebellion . one tool to keep blacks and whites from uniting was racism . edmund morgan , a historian of slavery in virginia , wrote in his american slavery , american freedom that racism was not a natural '' feeling about the differences between black and white . instead , white leaders encouraged a negative view of blacks . if poor whites felt contempt for african americans , they were less likely to join with them in rebellion . it 's the same strategy gone global . and now that we have instant global communication , they ca n't just lie about it in the newspaper and trick everyone . they have to actually act it out or find patsies to act it out for them . think about it ... do you actually have reason to hate anyone ? ... or have you only been taught who you should hate ? do you actually know for certain that the individuals in every terrorist act '' are actually who we are told they are ? would the people have actually had the motivation or resources to commit an act of terror or were they only able to do it because a government agency enabled it ? these are all legitimate questions . URL daniele ganser , professor of contemporary history at basel university switzerland and chairman or the aspo switzerland , published a landmark book about nato 's secret armies . '' according to him , during the last 50 years the united states have organized bombings in western europe that they have falsely attributed to the left and the extreme left with the purpose of discrediting them in the eyes of their voters . this strategy is still present today , inspiring fear for the islam and justifying wars on oil . tufts professor , michael glennon , even explains this in his book national security and double government '' . the tl dr is basically that you do n't have any choice or right to selfdetermination anymore because anything can be justified in the name of national security '' . URL national security policy in the united states has remained largely constant from the bush administration to the obama administration . this continuity can be explained by the double government theory of 19thcentury scholar of the english constitution walter bagehot . as applied to the united states , bagehot s theory suggests that u.s. national security policy is defined by the network of executive officials who manage the departments and agencies responsible for protecting u.s. national security and who , responding to structural incentives embedded in the u.s. political system , operate largely removed from public view and from constitutional constraints . the public believes that the constitutionallyestablished institutions control national security policy , but that view is mistaken . judicial review is negligible congressional oversight is dysfunctional and presidential control is nominal . so you saw that video off the charlie hebdo thing , right ? here is what i saw . i 'm no expert , but i have been putting in a lot of time into reading and learning how these operations work i saw a couple of professionals work smoothly and cleanly . they had a very wellplanned out attack and made a nice escape . it certainly did not look like a couple of guys who have never seen action and suddenly selfradicalized . even if you have trained , unless you have seen a lot of action and can control yourself , then you are going to be panicked and scattered . those guys were smooth and in control . not only that , but the big tipoff to me was the leaving behind of the id cards . this always conveniently happens . oswald 's wallet , james earl ray 's bundle of evidence '' , and even the passports that miraculously showed up at 911 . it 's a common tactic because it works so well on the general population and spin control through their agents in the media can discredit those who point out the absurdity . now what happened the next day ? well , a couple of guys took some hostages in a bakery or something . this is where those agents who try to find people willing to become radicals come in . if you had to make something like this happen , what do you do ? you probably show them that you can get them money and weapons . you probably use your knowledge of other fake acts by other agents to show them that you are connected to the terrorists . then you tell them , the signal is coming . there will be an attack today , then muslims like us everywhere across europe will stage a coordinated attack . your mission will be to hold hostages in this bakery ! '' then they see the attack happen and believe that it is real . these are n't ever really bright people to begin with so they never figure out they are being set up . the reality is those poor patsies would have probably never had a vector to do anything at all if these agencies had never enabled them . do you think they got those guns by themselves ? seriously ... this is how those types of things operate . you have to create an illusion like a magician . if you go and look at those jtrig slides , that 's exactly what they talk about . these guys love to compare themselves to magicians that create false realities . examples here URL and here URL i know it sounds like madness , but we have some really famous quotes to back it up william casey , cia director 19811987 we ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the american public believes is false. the aide said that guys like me were in what we call the realitybased community , '' which he defined as people who believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality . '' ... that 's not the way the world really works anymore , '' he continued . we 're an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality . and while you 're studying that realityjudiciously , as you willwe 'll act again , creating other new realities , which you can study too , and that 's how things will sort out . we 're history 's actors ... and you , all of you , will be left to just study what we do .

... by the upper 1020 of income levels . to give an idea of the size we 're talking here , if we assume 315 million people in the united states , you 're talking about 31,500,000 to 63,000,000 people having more power than the rest . well , no . data from tax returns show that the top 1 percent of households received 8.9 percent of all pretax income in 1976. in 2012 , the top 1 percent share had more than doubled to 22.46 percent . URL so the top 1020 of income earners is in no way 1020 of the population more likely less than 1 of the population by now , as the figures i cited here are 3 years old . apologies if i misunderstood your point here , but being able to predict policy by looking at the top 1020 of income earners which is much less than 1020 of the population seems to fit with the results of the study , which seems to fit with the definition of oligarchy a country , business , etc. , that is controlled by a small group of people . the saddest part of the us is an oligarchy '' article by gilens and page is that the authors are not saying the united states is an oligarchy . this reads like straight doublespeak friend .	cqsl84o	worldpolitics

why is this story being removed from all the popular subs over and over by mods ? message the admins about the censorship of this article by SUBREDDIT and SUBREDDIT mods . they have never seemed to care about this in the past but if enough users message them it will hopefully at least provoke a response of some kind . something needs to be done about this or this site needs to be abandoned as a platform for legitimate political discourse . important update so , it turns out that the SUBREDDIT mod USER who has been deleting all the instances of this story has previously been caught running a voting brigade to get antisemitic content upvoted on SUBREDDIT to discredit the sub . a fact which he admitted to me in another thread just a few minutes ago he claims he was doing an experiment '' ... . this guy needs to be banned from the site . liberals need to get something through their thick skulls diaspora zionists hasbaraniks like bipolarbear0 who is just one infinitesimal , atom of an example collectively dominate modern american liberalism , '' and have used media to shape the liberal consciousness to mirror the jewish tribal consciousness . this is why it 's so easy for diaspora zionists to manipulate and control liberal sites like reddit ... because modern liberal values have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with classical jeffersonian liberalism , and are all about either narcissistic , politically correct , perpetually injured '' and axgrinding identity politics , or about perpetuating the big brother values '' that define zionismbolshevism . until those who are truly liberal in the jeffersonian sense are capable of recognizing the very use of the term antisemitism '' as zionist hasbara , they 're going to just keep spinning their wheels and digging their own graves at the behest of the selfserving ideological diaspora zionist fifth column and the plutocracy and oligarchy they front for and bodyguard that is destroying democracy and america . it 's way past time for liberals and libertarians to grow up and welcome the antisemite '' smear from zionists and neocons as a merit badge ... or just kiss democracy goodbye forever and quite their bitching . anyone who wants true reform and integrity better damn well be prepared to take on the diaspora zionist fifth column and stop cowering like whipped dogs every time these selfserving demagogues and propagandists get out the antisemite '' card .	coxsna9	worldpolitics
its doubtful anyone will see this , but what the poster says is not wrong . perhaps , its purpose is misguided , but the actual text itself is not wrong . in a true capitalist market these needs would be met by the market because there are people who need money the jobless who can go into the market freely capitalism and fill the market need for that good . the role of government is to prevent that process from creating permanent destruction of goods valuable to the sustained persistence of the human race landairwaterpeople . for instance , in the housing market there would be two checks against commercial use of land , the market people already living there protecting the land through ownership and the government preventing the coerced removal of land ownerscontrolling urban sprawl via taxation . at the very least , that 's how i believe it would work . capitalism provides a surprising amount of checks and balances in the market that detractors write off because they are not present in america not a capitalist system anymore which leads to the promotion of democratic socialism , a notion that i understand in theory as being well intended but you must keep in mind the very limited power that we gave our gov in the constitution was corrupted in approx 70100 years to centralize and strengthen powers . under most socialist and communist structure the power is already too centralized and breeds corruption faster than our own system . one of the primary reasons our system failed and continues to fail , is the lack of education of the masses education being used here to describe the flow of information , transparency of government , etc that allows a populous to make informed decisions and hold politicians accountable . its fairly sad to watch .	cp6cf42	worldpolitics

it is narrative from trump , because it 's a story he 's telling . there are 2 aspects to the election rigging '' that trump likes to talk about . the first is the media . the argument is that the media spends much more time talking about trump and his issues than it does talking about hillary and her problems . this might be true , and outside of a few right leaning news outlets is probably accurate . we could discuss why that 's the case at length , but let 's just say it 's accurate that trump 's flaws are getting more coverage . the thing is , this is the exact same phenomenon that worked so well for trump in the primaries . every insult or criticism he hurled at an opponent got much more coverage than anything they said or did . the media loved the sensationalism and people ate it up . trump has , up until this point , been able to take advantage of having the spotlight on him , and rode it all the way to the gop nomination . the second issue is actual voter fraud or election rigging . this accusation is backed by no facts or findings from any election oversight or review for the last 20 years or more . the expert consensus is that us elections are far too decentralized to fix '' on a large scale . and the instances of voter fraud that have been documented were , according to one study from 2000 to 2016 , at a rate of 31 instances per 1 billion votes . in other words , statistically insignificant . trump saying that the actual mechanics of a us federal election are rigged '' is not only unjustified and seemingly factually inaccurate , it 's dangerous to the very fundamental beliefs and institutions that have made the us the great country that it is . these are the kind of ideas that lead some of his supporters to feel that they have no voice in the government and that the system is broken . when they feel that way , and are encouraged by a charismatic leader like trump , they may feel that the only choice is to take their government back by force . tl dr while it could be argued that there is an imbalance in media coverage , trump 's accusations that the election itself is rigged are not supported by any evidence , and are dangerous to our democracy .	d8xob8d	worldpolitics

had trump been impeached a year ago , pence would have remained a serious threat . x200b at this point , however ? dems have the house , and are thus able to block legislation from moving through . the trump administration 's credibility and political capital have largely been spent , and whatever is left would be lost during impeachment proceedings . pence would be so tarnished by association by the end that he 'd be unlikely to garner much support for any significant changes to the govt. , and pence does n't have the personal charisma to rally trump 's base the way trump himself can he 'd feel fake trying to emulate trump , and he 'd feel like just another superchristian republican politician if he is just himself . he wo n't be able to mobilize authoritarians , the core of trump 's support , to anywhere near the same extent , and without them being motivated enough to maintain their stranglehold on gop primaries many other gop politicians wo n't give pence the same level of support they currently do trump . x200b with the time the conclusion of the mueller investigation and full impeachment proceedings would take , pence would have a year , maybe a little more or less , in office , with no political clout to throw around , a split congress , and the taint of trump 's memory attached to him . after the last two years , i 'm ready for a completely impotent pence presidency until 2021 .	ebrfvib	worldpolitics
this guy is basically toby kebbell with more hair , haha . i think there are some critical points which they did n't go into which could have turned into more interesting minidebates 1. when they brought up sustainability , what is the whole process ? ed mentioned a bit about plant composting , but when it came to the stepbystep process he was n't sure about what has to be done other than it being something that we can consider . the reporter seemed to want to shift the argument to globalism which was relevant but a bit spurious in that moment . 2. on globalism , it would have been interesting to see how the process would go in changing the minds of small tribes or highly religious groups . the reporter had a strong point in that veganism is more of a practice suited for developed nations , but i was more interested in seeing the metaperspective of enforcing our ideals on lessdeveloped tribes . here we needed someone who was actually raised in such an environment where hunting was either necessary or unnecessary , and it would highlight cultural obstacles that vegans would face due to normalization . 3. on evolution , they should have defined healthy '' . they seemed conflicted on natural adaptation and gave up trying to debate diet . 4. with abortion , they were getting into the idea of what an animal is , which i felt the reporter was largely misinformed . if you are going to debate a person who bases their views in science , you should not debate them from a religious perspective unless the debate is about religious historical research . i really wanted to see some counterarguments from the bible , and ed made some solid cases of animal sacrifice no longer being necessary , but this is where the can of worms could have been opened in debating morality . the reporter just played it safe with arguing that american society largely was founded on christian principles it was actually more deist , but that 's beside the point . 5. the reporter started talking about how native americans respected animals ed could have clapped back about how settlers treated native americans considering she was arguing from a purist or fundamentalist perspective most of the time . missed opportunity .	e5lw9lk	worldpolitics

my only disagreement with this is that as one of the wealthiest presidents ever , washington was pretty firmly on the side of wealth . he wanted the masses involved in politics and to get a share of the national wealth to the degree that they felt enfranchised enough to support the government against the people who knew themselves to be locked out and not one bit more . madison in the federalist 10 stated it pretty baldly . and 'centrism ' is another word for 'business as usual ' . so i guess that 's two disagreements . a party explicitly for the majority of americans would be anything but centrist , unless you define medicare for all , stopping the perpetual war machine , higher wages for workers and higher taxes on the wealthy as 'centrist ' .	eqa8pj1	worldpolitics
