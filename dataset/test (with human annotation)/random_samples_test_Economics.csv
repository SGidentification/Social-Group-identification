this is a very important point . the slashing of interest rates by the fed is what lead to the housing boom , too many houses being built , and the massive over speculation of house prices . there is no way the free market can be blamed for this because as the article states , the easy money policy is what leads to bad investments because investors saw the economy through the rose colored glasses of low interest rates brought on entirely by the fed . utter nonsense . if you get busted for drinking and driving , do the bartenders who made it easy to get drinks and the dealerships who made it easy to buy a car get the blame ? no . banks were caught up in a prisoners dilemma of monster proportions and as a collective failed to see where their actions were taking them . again , the blame here belongs to the government . it has no business subsidizing financial institutions . because these institutions knew they had government backing , this led to reckless lending and more risk taking that would otherwise not be taken if they had to bear responsibility for losses all on their own ... again , government meddling with financial institutions led to loans being made to people who would otherwise not be able to get a loan for good reason . again , utter nonsense . the fm 's and the cra did n't require the banks and not just the lending banks to make bad decisions . this is not a free market failure because , as shown above , these loans should not have been made in the first place . when the market is n't free because of government meddling , how can you blame the bad outcome on the free market ? again , government subsidies and the fm 's may have made it easier for banks to make poor business decisions a necessary condition but is not a sufficient condition URL . this is definitely not because of the free market . the article clearly states that the easy money policy pursued by the fed caused malinvestment . bs . again , maybe necessary to explain this free market failure , but hardly sufficient . this ultimately boils down to a large conglomeration of businesses who did n't have the foresight to see how their collective action would play out . if it had n't been the housing market , the greedblinded banking institutions would have wound up finding another basis for the credit default swaps which ultimately were the unregulated market which set the markets unraveling after lehman failed . without the cds 's , lehmans failure would have had a marginal impact on the overall economy .	7s9a	Economics

center for american progress fellow robert gordon 19 noted that approximately half of the subprime loans were made by independent mortgage companies that were not regulated by the cra and thus had no government obligation to offer credit to minorities . in the later part of the crisis , these mortgage companies made subprime loans at twice the rate of cra banks . another third of the major subprime lenders were regulated but had very little cra involvement . 20 '' URL you 're right . there were plenty of people who got bad loans who were n't poor minorities .	c05rd26	Economics

first , what tortured reason do you see in hoppe 's piece ? there was an allegation with no substance in that attack . you 're still missing the point as to what economics models . mainstream economists make the mistake of trying predict the content of economic decisions and policies . but this is impossible to do considering economic decisions are based on human actions and you can not isolate variables in the way that you can in the lab . believing that you can do so is the fatal flaw '' that got us into this mess we have a bunch of really smart people thinking they can run the system . just look at ltcm there was a group of nobel prize winning economists and mathematicians . they thought their little empirical models and such were perfect . they ended up being the largest financial disaster in the last 20 years before these past few weeks . the austrians on the other hand seek to describe the form of economic activity and the necessarily true deductions you can make . keynes masked these individual actions by using aggregates and was summarily demolished multiple times by hayek . keynes even responded to one of hayek 's whippings by saying , that was long ago , i do n't believe that anymore ... . unfortunately , keynes 's nonsense was far more appealing to politicians since it would increase their power . also , the austrians do n't make value judgments about policies . the form of austrian arguments is if ... policy is implemented ... then , result . '' whereas neoclassical , or mainstream economists argue by saying , we should ... '' the problems with the neoclassical stance are too many to count . but i 'd say the most damning criticism is that what they suggest is basically social engineering . in essence , what you 're trying to do is use the wrong tools for the job . it 's tantamount to bringing a microscope out under the stars and saying you found something out about the planets . and as for mises and rothbard ... i use them as examples simply because they 're the best . rothbard in particular is good because he writes very clearly . there 's also hayek , megner , bohmbawerk very hard to read , be warned , hazlitt very easy to read . some more contemporary austrians are salerno , reisman , gordon , murphy , etc .	c05jgd7	Economics

that is , the situation is stable . share prices are never stable . market prices for stock can only exist when sellers and buyers do not agree on the value . that is why they change hands . you are asking for an absence of human action , an impossibility . when you toss in a bunch of extra shares , a lack of buyers for those extra fake shares does n't say anything about the number of buyers for legitimate shares , who , after all , have already bought all they wanted . extra shares are n't being tossed in '' . the number of shares outstanding has not increased . the number of shares outstanding is public information . so in order to actually complete a naked short sale , the shares have to be offered at a price lower than the value that the market has established for each of a given number of shares in xyz . right , but in order to complete a naked short sale , it is necessary that buyers do not abstain from buying the stock at any price but the original high '' price . this process does not affect the company 's fundamentals , and if buyers wo n't buy the stock at the high price , then the company is not worth the high price .	c085a8h	Economics

because the monetary base has increased substantially . yes , i know . but that does n't mean anything if it and additional bank credit does n't actually make its way into the economy . look at this chart URL . the money supply was soaring during the great depression , too . are you going to argue that the great depresion was hyperinflationary ? if you use a soaring money supply as the sole criterion , then you have to . similarly , look at japan . the boj printed like crazy and it did n't matter people just did n't borrow . and surprise , surprise government spending did n't do anything except astronomically increase government debt . once that money leaves the banking system , it should collapse the dollar . of course . but if the money does n't leave the banking system , mish is right . and his point is it did n't happen in the great depression , it did n't happen in japan , and there 's no reason for it to happen here today . in fact , he says it ca n't happen yet banks are too capital impaired to lend and consumers are too debtridden to borrow . and we have n't even seen the full storm yet of sivs , credit card debt , student loan debt , auto debts , commercial real estate debt , and retiring , bankrupt boomers . much of this debt ca n't be serviced especially with falling wages and rising unemployment and what ca n't be paid back will be defaulted on , which will further cause bank balance sheets to contract and impair lending . plust you have to factor in higgs ' regime uncertainty all the crazy shit government will do will furhter prevent private actors from risking their money in the marketplace . how is it possible to get hyperinflation out of that mix ? if the fed never stops printing , hyperinflation will happen but not until loads of debt is serviceddefaulted upon . and since we wo n't take the proper medicine , this will probably take years , which leads me to believe that mish 's thinking is correct recession followed by years of modest inflation with intermittent spurts of growth . only then can actual hyperinflation be a threat . i will say that i do n't think there can be deflation psychology without deflation existing . the article addresses multiple hyperinflationist arguments and refutes them . even if you do n't agree with it , i guarantee that you will find it an interestnig read .	c07cf9f	Economics

i believe you are overestimating the amount of churn by orders of magnitude . turnover is not 1000 times larger than profits in most companies . more on this later i thought i explained myself pretty clearly . if you are making a 500 transaction , of which 100 is profit , then whether you are taxed 1 on the transaction or 5 on the profit makes no difference , you 'll still pay 5 in tax and have only 95 in your pocket at the end of the day . in my calculations i taxed each transaction at 1 . i did not tax profits . i taxed 1 of the whole value of the transaction . redoing the calculations using a 0.01 transaction tax , the business owners would have 99.87 in their pocket and the megacorp shareholders would have 99.94 . i did n't say corporations mine all their raw materials . some mine their major raw materials , some do n't . in my specific example they did . in the modified example , you can include additional raw materials in the category office supplies , electricity etc '' . big companies will churn more . period . big companies churn more in absolute terms because they 're bigger . obviously a company making 1000 cars is going to pay more gross tax than a company making 10 cars . that 's not the point . the point of my example is to show that when a corporation grows vertically , they churn less for each of goods they produce , compared with independently run companies , i.e . they end up having a lower tax rate under your scheme . i do n't think you understand how the stock market works . there 's market makers who place limit orders and regular investors . on top of brokerage fees , investors loose money to market makers on the bidoffer spread . even for very liquid stocks , the bid offer spread has an order of magnitude of 0.1 , so adding a 0.01 tax is n't going to make a huge difference . investors would have to be moving around their entire investment capital multiple times every week to generate the same kind of tax revenue as the current 35 capital gains tax for investments held less than 1year in the top tax bracket . if you want to check my math a 35 tax on profits translates to a 1.75 tax on the initial capital assuming a yearly return of 5 . so you 'd have to move your capital 175 times with a 0.01 transaction tax to pay the same amount of tax .	c18vvic	Economics

it is still deflationary in theory it might stabilize in long term . and thus still favors early miners of bitcoins . not miners but those who invested in bitcoins , either in form of mining hardware or buying them on open market . yes , you can go and buy them . as long as mining is profitable people will invest into hardware , which will make mining harder and thus eventually it will cease to be very profitable . thus it would n't matter if you 're a miner or an investor . so i see no problem here . there was ludicrous opportunities but soon they will vanish . there is still a lot of coins to mine only 6.5m out of 21m were mined , so it is not like early adopters got everything , if you join now you still can get a decent share through open market . though i suppose if the bitcoin producers are giving money to people who run necessary computing operations for them , fair enough . there are no 'bitcoin producers ' mining nodes award bitcoins to themselves when they discover blocks and the rest of the network agrees because they believe in the original design . so it is not settled yet that emission of new coins will stop . if majority in terms of computing resources will agree that they ' want to continue emission they can do that by using a patched software . then the rest of network will have to agree , otherwise it is going to suck for them .	c1xcqbr	Economics

americans rarely ever elect harsh tellers of reality , because the dream of the good life and all the entrapments of dreams well played and worked for are the meaning of life and to take those away would cause massive intellectual angst , so people vote for who will keep their dreams alive , no matter how much of a lie it is . i could n't agree with you more . there is a famous speech by teddy roosevelt in chicago , 1899 that i absolutely love called the strenuous life URL . although it was mainly about the need for american imperialism i do n't think he would agree with what the us has done now , it talks a lot about what is needed from men to make the us great and does not beat around the bush . a life of slothful ease , a life of that peace which springs merely from lack either of desire or of power to strive after great things , is as little worthy of a nation as of an individual . i ask only that what every selfrespecting american demands from himself and from his sons shall be demanded of the american nation as a whole . who among you would teach your boys that ease , that peace , is to be the first consideration in their eyesto be the ultimate goal after which they strive ? you men of chicago have made this city great , you men of illinois have done your share , and more than your share , in making america great , because you neither preach nor practise such a doctrine . you work yourselves , and you bring up your sons to work . if you are rich and are worth your salt , you will teach your sons that though they may have leisure , it is not to be spent in idleness for wisely used leisure merely means that those who possess it , being free from the necessity of working for their livelihood , are all the more bound to carry on some kind of nonremunerative work in science , in letters , in art , in exploration , in historical researchwork of the type we most need in this country , the successful carrying out of which reflects most honor upon the nation . we do not admire the man of timid peace . we admire the man who embodies victorious effort the man who never wrongs his neighbor , who is prompt to help a friend , but who has those virile qualities necessary to win in the stern strife of actual life . it is hard to fail , but it is worse never to have tried to succeed . in this life we get nothing save by effort . freedom from effort in the present merely means that there has been stored up effort in the past . a man can be freed from the necessity of work only by the fact that he or his fathers before him have worked to good purpose . if the freedom thus purchased is used aright , and the man still does actual work , though of a different kind , whether as a writer or a general , whether in the field of politics or in the field of exploration and adventure , he shows he deserves his good fortune . but if he treats this period of freedom from the need of actual labor as a period , not of preparation , but of mere enjoyment , even though perhaps not of vicious enjoyment , he shows that he is simply a cumberer of the earth 's surface , and he surely unfits himself to hold his own with his fellows if the need to do so should again arise . a mere life of ease is not in the end a very satisfactory life , and , above all , it is a life which ultimately unfits those who follow it for serious work in the world . leaders like that are long gone .	c68sbvo	Economics

that does n't really matter . being a closed system absolutely matters if you are going to cite the second law of thermodynamics . you can not completely convert all energy in a system completely to work ever is the point , good thing there is always more energy being put into the system . and there is also a limit to how much energy reaches the earth in a given space and time interval . solar powered satellites , collect light the never reaches earth in the first place . same for space based solar power systems URL , researched since the 70s . then you have dyson speres URL , i.e . holy crap freeman dyson hypothesized this exact problem in 1960 , and devised concept for the dyson swarm , dyson bubble , dyson shell and dyson sphere . then in 1964 , you had nikolai kardashev , create the kardashev scale URL , meant to classify civilizations on their energy consumption , that has direct bearing on our conversation type i technological level close to the level presently attained on earth , with energy consumption at 41019 ergsec 1 4 1012 watts . guillermo a. lemarchand stated this as a level near contemporary terrestrial civilization with an energy capability equivalent to the solar insolation on earth , between 1016 and 1017 watts . 2 type ii a civilization capable of harnessing the energy radiated by its own star for example , the stage of successful construction of a dyson sphere , with energy consumption at 41033 ergsec . 1 lemarchand stated this as a civilization capable of utilizing and channeling the entire radiation output of its star . the energy utilization would then be comparable to the luminosity of our sun , about 4 1026 watts . 2 type iii a civilization in possession of energy on the scale of its own galaxy , with energy consumption at 41044 ergsec . 1 lemarchand stated this as a civilization with access to the power comparable to the luminosity of the entire milky way galaxy , about 4 1037 watts . 2 funny these brilliant minds in 1964 with less technology than we have today did n't break down and go but you ca n't have exponential growth '' , it was obvious to them that you could , but then again they were n't limiting themselves by post hoc rationalizing everything to fit a social narrative either . that 's the first law wrt entropy , and not really ironic given that allele frequencies have little to do with economics . nope , creationists used predominantly the second law to try to disprove evolution URL , the same way you are trying to disprove economics , by ignoring the fact that humanity , our earth and everything we are , is not an isolated system .

if anything we can conclude that monetary policy is the importent thing . whereever the central bank acted correctly , keeping montary equillibrum , mv on track it worked out . the us has much better growth since qe3 and is back on track . switzerland does nicly even while surounded by problems . sweden avoid the crisis almost completly but it seams the central bank is dropping the ball at themoment . some of these countrys did austerity and othres did neither stimulus nor austerity . australia is another case where montary policy did well and the country saw no recession there ngdp growth is to high , if you ask me but at least the did not let it drop and stayed consistent . i dont want to clame austerity has no impact on growth , it probebly does . but my point is just this , by far the first most importent thing is to get montary policy right , then long nothing and then you can start arguing if 5 goverment spending change in either direction really has such a large impact or not . the most importent thing we should learn from the last 5 years is that liquidty traps do not exists , or maybe they only exist in central bankers minds . with good central bank commitment you are never in a liquidity trap . switzerland , america and now japan skeptical lets see if the policys hold up are good examples . in theory this has long been pointed out by people like svenson , woodford and so on , now we see that it actually works in pratices and we should finally overcome this myth that has been standing for 70 years . why krugman and co still hold to it , i do not for the live of me understand .	cdxmutq	Economics

the issuer of the dollar does n't need to offer treasuries in the first place as the issuer is not funding constrained in the currency it issues treasuries are simply an interestpaying convenience vehicle for dollar holders alright , i see what you 're saying . instead of selling bonds , just print the money that you would spend anyway , that way you do n't have to pay interest . the problem with that is that it brings the problems inherent in money printing up immediately as opposed to somewhere in the future . the entity that receives the printed money buys goods , and then the entity that sold the goods will immediately seek out goods to buy as well . in the scenario where the second entity buys bonds , they do not immediately seek out the goods to buy , as they can buy bonds instead . and , as i 've mentioned numerous times at this point , the problems occur when the second entity seeks to buy goods . to explain what i mean in the real world . scenario 1 we offer bonds for sale . we print money , distribute to our people . our people buy chinese goods . china buys us bonds . scenario 2 we do n't offer bonds for sale . we print money , distribute to our people . our people buy chinese goods . china tries to buy us goods . i 'm sure you understand how the different scenarios would create different results in the economy , correct ?	cgcfzx7	Economics

i think you bring up an excellent point here . the economics behind this can be wonky at times . but if you think of the labor market , being made up of labor suppliers employees and labor demanders employers , automation will reduce the number of jobs available . if this was the only change nominal wages would decline , but if there is a drop in labor supply , we just do n't know what nominal wages would do . we would need to know the relative size of the shifts in labor demand and supply to disentangle the effect on nominal wages . to your point of downward pressure on inflation , i again think this all depends on what the labor market does . i 'm just not up to speed on the composition of amazon 's workforce , the current market wages , and regional employment numbers to accurately speak to this . your concerns are valid .	dj5fgty	Economics

you really think my coursework is ok as is ? that surprises me , but makes me feel a lot better about it , thanks ! i 've looked at a just a couple of programs and i guess they stipulated basically the same thing , taking a few undergrad courses during the masters program . i 'd still probably take a few undergrad courses before i apply anywhere , at least to know what i 'm getting myself into and to get letters of rec . but did someone seriously downvote your comment and not say why ? that is literally the least helpful thing someone could do . i appreciate you taking the time to give me your advice .	eyhmvj3	Economics
i had that in mind . i m speaking with hyperbole and without any real data so it s definitely not entirely accurate . but the point remains , it s not the 80s and 90s anymore and a lot of people lost their properties in the 08 recession and property values across the country have been steadily rising , with property taxes keeping pace . if homelessness is the issue at hand , then all the lucky bastards who inherited their properties , and can afford them still , are not really the discussion point . it s property for sale that s the issue	f6y1w7i	Economics
