the headline here is deliberately misleading . the labour vote was 3 . the 13 which the nearest challenger , the scottish nationalist party snp got , came from the conservatives 3 and the liberal democrats 10 . winning a byelection when in government , midterm , is a good result . to increase both the number of votes and the share of your votes is very , very unusual . no wonder gordon brown is happy .	c068tab	ukpolitics

so , you 're saying that after the uk reduced it 's top rate of tax , the proportion of tax paid by top rate taxpayers in the usa and canada increased by over 10 , as it did in the uk ? without the americans canadians altering their own tax rates . the paper i ca n't find , but would love to refer you to , cites that in all three countries tax receipts from high income earners increased over a period 198895 ? and that in the uk this success was credited to tax reforms without looking at the fact that other countries also saw significant economic benefits over the same period without changes in tax regime . the lowering of higher income tax was also credited as being the reason that for the first time the top 5 of earners were paying more in tax than the rest even at the lower rates , in retrospect however it is likely that this would have actually occurred anyway and that it is possible that the uk government lost out on tax revenue rather than the opposite but in a world of rising tax revenue , who cares ... . as i recall this was an issue in the usa presidential election , when questioned on his stated policy of raising the top rate of income tax , against the evidence , mr obama said something along the lines of he wanted to do it anyway , even if revenue was reduced , so taxes were 'seen to be fair ' . punitive taxes , rather than revenue raising taxes . i 'm not sure that quoting election campaign discussions helps , although it is true to say that many people in the us oppose higher taxes on the rich or indeed anyone regardless and expect much less from the state and so see less benefit from taxations .	c09pina	ukpolitics

my largest concern with av is that it naturally encourages every candidate in every constituency to move to the middle ground in order to pick up trailing preference votes . i disagree you effectively have a second chance so you can use your first votes on prefered candidates who may not have much chance , which in turn gives them a chance . it is much better than the only having the one vote , which people tend to put on someone who has a chance of winning and which does incentivise the middle ground .	c0k15gv	ukpolitics

this is also rubbish . i did n't get the grades i needed to get into university , but my interest and enthusiasm was apparent in the interviews i had . while they are n't essential my grades were n't particularly good either i know of plenty of people who were n't able to get into university because of grades , especially this year when the number of places has been cut down drastically . i think . i was pretty lucky since when i started uni in 2006 they were taking anybody who could get the money and the slc 's were handing it out to anyone who wanted it ! . the problem with the loans system is that it assumes every student will pass and every student will be able to get a good job out of it . the level of debt is large enough that it could be the difference between a student being able to repeat a year or having to drop out and the job market can be temperamental , we already see many employers looking for a minimum of a 2.1. the fehe are just minor extra hurdles though and do n't even involve the people causing problems or sitting on benefits anyway . for me , the problem in regards to our 14year old stabbists is with primarysecondary education where the quality of school and the unavoidable extra tutoring really have a large impact . while it is possible to succeed regardless and there are problems with the welfare system we have in place i 'm glad that welfare system is there as the alternative is far worse for the unfortunate and the rest of the population . the main contributors to the social problems are the education system and the general social segregation caused by it and town planning . do n't worry about downvoting , i 'm not posting for reassurance if i did i 'd be in SUBREDDIT posting meme comments and i would n't think any less of you for downvoting anyway , i know it 's against reddiquette to downvote for disagreeing but that seems to be how most people handle it anyway . the tone of my posts probably deserves it too anyway !	c0yrmcf	ukpolitics

it seems we 're going to have a libdem home secretary , should they manage to back up the rhetoric they 've had in opposition about civil liberties and state interference this could be the most significant feature of the new administration	c0pt88e	ukpolitics
she 's not actually criticising the authoritarian nature of the labour party or suggesting civil liberties are key a principle , she 's simply saying they need to jump on this bandwagon . there i agree , listening to the party at the moment it is clear that the window of opportunity to implement real , useful change is a slim one and one that is being slowly closed by elements within the party that i see as reflecting the worst parts of the new labour project . also , it does n't appear that many labour voters really did switch to the liberal democrats at all it 's rather hard to judge and i think there is a north south split as well . i spent a lot of time canvassing in manchester before the election and live in sheffield , there were and are a very large number of people who used to vote labour , indeed still support the notion of labour , but voted lib dem because they had had enough of new labour . that is possibly a misguided notion , but one that is moderately prevalent , indeed during the coalition talks quite a few people i spoke to did trot out the ' i did n't vote lib dem for to get a tory government , i should have voted labour ' line . it seems to me that labour voters '' have a history of claiming they 'll vote one way , before voting another entirely . i think this applies to 'voters ' generally . the constituency i spent most of my time in seemed to be showing a massive level of support for the lib dems , something that did n't materialise on polling day the labour candidate actually increased his majority without a massive increase in turnout ... . of course it is almost impossible to get a clear view of exactly what happened with the vote without doing a lot of analysis on polling day at the count which the major parties did , but i doubt that they would release the results publicly , positive or otherwise .	c0qe8ih	ukpolitics

why has it become popular for anyone in the military to be called a hero , other than to elicit support for an unpopular war ? i think it has become universal for the exact opposite reason . by stating explicitly that you support the troops , you can then criticise policy , tactics and the government . which makes your attacks harder to deflect as being unpatriotic .	c0kpt76	ukpolitics

thanks for the debate . safe seats are n't some sort of antidemocratic magic , they are constituencies where the vast majority of people happen to support a particular party , i will also add that in the last election labour did win the popular vote.. so it seems a little unfair to suggest that they tool the least number ... whilst this is true it makes it very difficult for major reform to happen , which i think we need and i dislike them for that reason . you just need to make sure your local mp feels the same way , there are plenty of anti war labour mp 's , quite a few lib dem mp 's with dubious positions on the media and there may even be conservative mp 's out there who are worth voting for ... i 've looked at what my mp does and what those standing are supporting and i think this is my best choice , but i appreciate you encouraging people to think more about who they vote for . 500 and you could have been that candidate ... also , you could still help out with the various local ppuk campaigns if you wanted to help ... unfortunately i ca n't go into detail but i am not able to stand or take part in active political campaigning due to my current job .	c0orepj	ukpolitics

the conservatives of then i 'm saying nothing about now also were a force reacting against social changes . this was seen in section 28 and continued attacks on groups like single parents . i still maintain however that the route course of this was more from what was seen as being an economically viable perspective more than social norms favoured by right wing ideology . thatcher was heavily influenced by hayek and the like . i would think isaiah berlin and his concepts of positive and negative freedom lay at the core of her philosophy , though traditionalism and nationalism are factors that should not be overlooked . when i state traditionalism , i do not mean necessarily support for established institutions . thatcher and the queen had no love lost , and her relationship with doctorsthe medical establishment was hardly rosey . she was far more mercantile , something upper classes frowned upon . it was n't all about unions . as for nationalism , the falklands was not just a get of jail card , but an echo of decaying empire . note how although s. africa was no longer commonwealth and a point of deep upset to queen liz , but more important in terms of trade rather than sanctions . it all comes down to filthy lucre in the end . i 'm amazed i have got through this thread without a rant so far . something from around 1980 .

no the market prices are kept high by the risk they run because of the illegality of their business . the inherant production cost of growing a cannabis plant is low if it does not have to be done under artificial lighting away from prying eyes . if it were grown like any other crop is , it could be produced as cheaply as they are . yes , black market growers of any plant can undercut legitimate farmers if they avoid taxes and such , but they must consider the repercussions if they are caught doing this . if there is nothing to fear from growing cannabis , it can be produced more cheaply by legal farmers than illegal ones who have to spend time and money avoiding the authorities . tax can still be applied to make a profit for hmrc , but even if it is at a low rate which severely undercuts the illegal growers , it is still money generated as opposed to money spent . if the governmet wished and they likey would do this imo they would continue to apply pressure to the illegal market in the way they do now in order to force growers to become legitimate . it 's an attractive option for the growers to become legal and regulated cheaper , safer for them which provides an incentive to switch .	c2jog0o	ukpolitics
they have a slow version whereby rather than doing it all in one go they have one election then they eliminate the lowest candidates and then redo the vote . then they do it again in 2001 they had 3 ballots here URL uk leadershipelection , 2001 contestrules , here URL is the one for david cameron winning . here URL is another article describing the thing as a whole . in short the conservatives to use av but in a slow and silly way of doing it . do you think that the current government represents what the people want ? with the majority of people voting for left leaning governments and the current majority of new implementations and laws coming in being on the right . fptp is most definetely failing as lib dems got 23 of the vote ans 9 of the mp 's massive scientific disparity there , conservatives 37 of the vote and 47 of the seats , labour 29 of vote 39 of seats . how is this working ? now lets say it was working . you say why change it ? well newtons laws of motion work to a large extent but they most certainly are not completely correct , without the proper and newer einsteinian and lorentz version gps satalites would not work . so , even tiny improvements in something can make much greater things possible . the way you are defining winner is so very wrong aswell . if they won with first past the post then they won by misinterpretation of the results . there are so many mathematical models which show where fptp fails miserably . the fact that i do n't even need to use these and that almost every election since the 60s has been a misrepresentation of the populace is ridiculous . my own personal gripe with politics and i 'm sure many scientists concur is that the strength of the leader matters . to a scientist this is repulsive and its the strength and quality of the ideas which should be heald up to the public , and the person should be inconsequential . if i were to try and challenge a two year old who had taken the stance 11 2 provided the understand the logic around this i should not be able to disprove them and to do so would be using false logic .	c1pdf74	ukpolitics

but maybe you risk generalising islamic cultures '' significantly in decrying them as backward '' in comparison to british society and that perhaps this particular issue of disagreement is more of an aesthetic concern , rather than a urgent issue of liberal undoing . in fact the creation of the article , in the context of increasingly inflated concerns about immigration particularly muslim immigrants is doing little to contribute to a healthy debate but rather focusing on a rather facile statistic in order to increase islamaphobic tensions . we live in a multicultural society and so surely it is important to look for ways to accommodate other cultures in the areas that it is possible for us to do so , in order that they might be more willing to accommodate our concerns over areas of their culture such the marginilisation of women from positions of power . this could be possible through reasoned dialogue , which is an environment hinder by the constant antimuslim rhetoric that is produced by prominent sections of the media . i take your point that the separation of the sexes in a way , on some level , part of the system which deprives women of equal rights , yet could it also be argued that many immigrants that have moved to this country are likely to have done so precisely because they wish to live in a more liberal , equal society , yet also wish to retain parts of their traditional culture as expression of their personal and group identities as do all people . therefore allowing them the freedom to participate in such activities which do not actively conflict with our cultural values should be allowed in order that our liberal principles that grants all individuals the right to do so be satisfied .	c9xtlpf	ukpolitics

better wait until the party manifesto is published for the election . no point in reading up and being of the mind ukip is the way forward when no ukip mp 's is standing for election in your area , so check who is standing in your area and what they can do to make where you live better first . form your own opinions not what the media say . you say the bedroom tax is absurd why do you think that . personally i see its merits we have a lack of council housing , for me it makes sense for an elderly couple living in a 3 bed semi council house being moved into a smaller property so that a family that is being housed in private accommodation subsidised at your expense could live without fear the landlord ends the rental agreement or sells the property , who would you vote for it they laid bare and said if we enforce the bedroom tax properly , education would be free what does your head and heart say now , you might counter if we cut the defence budget a bit we could fund education it that way , however that means people losing jobs directly and indirectly employed by that sector . or your 24 now would you be happy if taxes were raised to pay for free education which you would not be entitled to . research is the key now and a lot of cutting the wheat from the chaff to get to the key issues that personally affect you .	cm8v4pu	ukpolitics

USER care to have a stab at addressing this quote i 've pulled out ? as it 's an accurate representation on how a lot of ukip members feel concerning this aspect of eu migration i honestly think that it 's a price worth paying . the extent to which mixing european cultures brings europe closer together enriches us all and , beyond that , if it 's the price of continued eu membership , then cutting it off would be akin to taking a tremendous economic , social and political blow for something that does n't warrant such drastic action . i 'm not denying that it 's an issue that needs addressing , quite urgently . but the appropriate way to deal with wage depression is n't through choking off supply of labour it 's by encouraging strong , responsible unions , and harsh government action to enforce the minimum wage and workers ' rights . pulling up the drawbridge is a clumsy , unreasonable way of doing dealing with the issue that 's likely to cause greater damage than good . i expect a number of regulars here will be queuing up to disagree here but we know exactly how that argument will end up .	cjbiinv	ukpolitics

if we treat leaving the eu and cutting foreign aid by 85 as a zero sums game then yes , there will be funds to cut tax . however , if we did leave the eu we 'll still have to make trade agreements with the eu , and supposedly the prime example of this is norway , however norway still has to abide by 34 of eu legislation , as well as pay a fee , if the uk was in the same position as norway we would be paying up to around 4 billion this is the favourable situation so that 's 4 billion gone . not only that but the economic effect of leaving the eu has n't been taken into account , even the slightest threat of scottish independence wiped billions off scottish firms . what would happen to the pound ? what would happen to foreign and domestic investment ? what would our negotiating position be ? would the european headquarters of foreign businesses pull out ? what would the effect be on the uk 's financial system ? the uk splitting from the eu would have a tremendous negative economic effect on the uk economy , would the tax breaks then even really matter after that ?	ckttst9	ukpolitics

interesting idea but 5 years seems excessive . i guess it depends what immigrant '' actually means in practice . i emigrated to canada from the uk . firstly as a work permit holder twice and then finally as a permanent resident as i have a canadian wife . both times with the work permit i had to take out private insurance for a period even while working and paying in taxes like everyone else . that 's just how it is to start with and is a condition of entry into canada in the first instance . they can deny you the permit when you stump up at the border if you ca n't show your policy . but after barely a few months you generally become eligible to avail of healthcare services in your local province provided you 're actually a resident . if you 're a temporary resident eg on a work permit then you 'll need a job and be earning to qualify . once you become a permanent resident or full citizen you 're treated just like everyone else you do n't necessarily have to be employed . it seems reasonable enough and the waiting period '' of a few months seems to suffice . you do n't just get people showing up the day before and checking themselves into hospital to get dealt with .	couqveu	ukpolitics

well he did a pretty bad job of that because he said now remember sexual relations is permissable they are now his property '' . the notion of a consenting slave is an absolute joke . that 's not something that i thought needed to be pointed out . if you 're taught that a perfect man used infidel sex slaves in such a way . maybe you just might feel justified in taking an infidel ages 9 and up as that which under your right hand you possess ? but most modern islam also says well mohammed clearly didn't.. who do you think has moral authority here ? slaves are being sold in lebanon and lybia right now.. URL from sahih muslim , volume 2 , 3432 abu said alkhudri reported that at the battle of hunain allah 's messenger sent an army to autas and encountered the enemy and fought with them . having overcome them and taken them captives , the companions of allah 's messenger seemed to refrain from having intercourse with captive women because of their husbands being polytheists . then allah , most high , sent down regarding that and women already married , except those whom your right hands possess quran 424 raping women shortly after many of their husbands had been killed , lovely moral example there . would n't expect anyone that thought this was a good example to ever do a thing like rape anyone now would you ? many muslims regard this collection as the second most authentic of the six major hadith collections , 5 containing only sahih hadith , an honor it shares only with sahih albukhari , both being referred to as the two sahihs .

i was n't talking about social care , i think that is actually defensible and if it were just that alone , i do n't think it would be such an issue . however , they not only released that extremely controversial policy but also told us they 're going to take food out of childrens mouths and warmth away from pensioners . i get that these are being means tested , i agree that they should but how on earth they did n't see how this would be reported , i do not know . they also had no big retail offers that would counter the negative ones , it 's just one huge shitey sandwich and they have the nerve to think we 're all going to rush out to take a bite . cameron would never had made this kind of error .	di1lok9	ukpolitics

for a long time the eu project has been a collectivist , highly centralised , open borders set up and that is not conservative in any way . conservatism is about preservation of tradition , preserving of values and historical norms , preservation of peoples and communities . it 's about small government , decentralisation of power . the nation state , borders etc . conservatism is everything the eu is n't . it 's totally contradictory . there 's a reason thatcher grew to despise the eu . the eurosceptics are a minority faction of the tory party that 's because the tories are n't conservatives . the party system works where politicians are selected by the leadership so they 'll support their agenda . that agenda has n't been conservative for a long time . it 's why may 's conference speech sounded like it could have come out of corbyn 's mouth .	dpu4ku7	ukpolitics

you 've made the same mistake a number of times here so i wo n't address them individually . you 've conflated betterworse with sovereign and not sovereign . it does n't matter if it is better or worse in anyone 's opinion , it is not sovereignty and that for the majority is the problem . entering into the eu was a sovereign act . no it was n't , we joined in 1973 and then had a referendum in 1975 after the government had already joined . the u.k. never lost its sovereignty yet we ca n't leave unless the eu lets us . nor can we leave the backstop unless the eu lets us , and regardless of whether you see it as better or worse we are still answerable to eu courts . we most certainly did lose our sovereignty . as for your lobbying point . your implication is that the u.k. is immune to this ? no certainly not , my implication is that it adds an unnecessary avenue for corruption , which it does .	ea98s0c	ukpolitics
