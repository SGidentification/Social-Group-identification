suggestion on the scheduled day of mccain 's speech , 9408 , check online sources for the total number of people arrested in st. paul and send one dollar for each one of them to either the obama campaign , a democratic candidate or the democratic party . the best way to fight the gop police state is by positive information campaigns , so if you like this idea , please spread the word .	c059dtb	politics

well said . i do think that our image will improve in the world immediately with obama and that he will inspire more and more people to do work at the local level . i am a lazy bastard but have been volunteering to get obama elected and have found that i have more and more things i am willing to work for as an activist . the ship analogy is apt but the democrats may also pick up quite a few seats in congress which will help obama greatly in getting things done more quickly . we need a new fdr or jfk . not mccain .	c0454cm	politics

free education will solve this loud complaint on reddit . the problem is not only education . providing free education will not magically solve problems and increase the size of the economy . education has a certain cost firstly it is the cost of educating e.g . resources , cost of a teacher , etc ... . secondly it is the lost labour a person who is studying does not create wealth . for 4 years it can add up to quite a lot . studying is good but then it should be well motivated smart people in the right economically advantageous areas . one problem with the usa is that the percentage of people studying science and engineering as a percentage of the entire student body is lower than other countries such as china . i doubt the usastarbucks needs another million history majors .	c06tjk7	politics

all these businesses are still going to be taxed on their income , which will probably pay back the original stimulus outlay . and to top it all off the national fuel economy averages will improve . ok , this is going to require some mathematical analysis to prove true or false . the problem is that the clunkers require more gas than the newer more efficient cars that are being bought . which in turn means less gas being bought and less federalstate income tax being received from sales on the gas . but i like the original premise . i would hope that there are some cpa types that could take a closer look at this . upvoted .	c0blgxh	politics

that does n't happen with slander cases , though . judges wo n't even hear cases unless you start by showing rather clear cases of bad faith , and attempting to file too much can lead to sanctions can lead to it easily , if tort reform keeps going through . we live by innocent until proven guilty , in the us . only the most deliberate , boldfaced lies from meaningful personalities would ever incur any kind of investigation . there would be no point in declaring it a tort if it was so frequently filed that no one took them seriously . i see your point , but that speaks more towards logistical issues than actually deeming whether or not there should be any sanctions whatsoever . it seems like saying it 'd be hard to balance '' is just a copout , to me .	c0examv	politics
the very purpose of the bill is to put together a commission oriented towards liberalizing the nation 's drug laws . if this amendment passes , it 's a stealth vote against the commission , because the commission wo n't be able to recommend certain courses of action . cannabis will be legalized when another 15 years worth of seniors die off . in the western u.s. states , there 's already a majority support for legalization . when cannabis is legalized in these states , we 'll finally have data about whether such legalization is really so terrible . this opens the door to an empirical approach to drug legislation . edit one of the reasons the drug war does n't work is drug addicts often need to sell drugs to feed their expensive addiction . these are the folks getting 3 year mandatory minimums for selling , and they 're the people least likely to be discouraged by a chance of a long sentence . they 're also likely to try to win over new addicts . and , when street prices for drugs are 20x what they cost to produce on an industrial scale , it 's not surprising some steal to support a habit instead . let the addicts voluntarily lock themselves in shooting galleries where nurses can watch them , give them counseling , and keep them alive . let recreational users pay for this service .	c0fah78	politics

actually i see an interesting precedent being set . it is my opinion that no presidency can come to full term without having committed crimes by some definition . maybe carter would be the sole exception , but he was n't very effective either . normally in this country we have a peaceful transition of power . once the precedent is set that when the party in power changes they try to throw the previous administration in prison , we will no longer have peaceful transitions of power . obama must realize that the favor will be returned when he leaves office .	c091s3o	politics

'' i am not poor , and i am surely not rich but no one likes paying taxes . they will always blame the other guy for not paying enough . people seem to mix up fair '' , and economically favorable '' . one definitely does not imply the other . so , as a society , we need to decide which we want , and go from there . fair '' is extremely difficult to define , but easy to understand so , it holds the most political power . economically favorable '' is vice versa with certain assumptions .	c0eze50	politics

fact the socalled affordable health care such as group health forces women to have a midwife who does not have an m.d . to take care of their prenatal needs . these people due to their lack of proper training are unable to correct or even recognize problems should they occur . fact while it may be a personal choice , many are afraid to visit the doctors or hospital when needed due to the insane cost of giving birth here in the states . even in columbia it is free to have a baby , medical care wise . fact infant mortality rates does not imply prenatal as i 'm sure you are aware that prenatal does infact refer to the period in which the fetus is in the womb . if it did include these people , the numbers would be higher just simply for the many women who suffer through many miscarriages before the pregnancy takes . fact once a child is born , these antiabortionists could care less about what happens to them obviously since many of these people are all for cutting down the funding of state funded health care and so these children receive less than stellar care . that all being said , the current health plan is not optimal and definitely needs tweeking as that i forsee many individuals becoming financially ruined .	c0faha1	politics

considering how uncontroversial the bill was and how simplistically empathic the act i 'm not sure it reflects something special about him , at least what we should take to be special . i think it says volumes more about the world in which we live that saying something so true and sensible is considered rare , and apathy and indifference so causally taken to be the norm . it 's not a question of whether he 's a journalist , rather the question should be , how can anyone with the power to speak out on this issue sit idly by and say nothing ?

lol you ca n't accept reality and change it at the same time . the trick is to start small . look at the great learning only after knowing what to abide in can one be calm . only after having been calm can one be tranquil . only after having achieved tranquility can one have peaceful repose . only after having peaceful repose can one begin to deliberate . only after deliberation can the end be attained . things have their roots and branches . affairs have their beginnings and their ends . to know what is first and what is last will lead one near the way . the ancients who wished to manifest their clear character to the world would first bring order to their states . those who wished to bring order to their states would first regulate their families . those who wished to regulate their families would first cultivate their personal lives . those who wished to cultivate their personal lives would first rectify their minds . those who wished to rectify their minds would first make their wills sincere . those who wished to make their wills sincere would first extend their knowledge . the extension of knowledge consists in the investigation of things . when things are investigated , knowledge is extended when knowledge is extended , the will becomes sincere when the will is sincere , the mind is rectified when the mind is rectified , the personal life is cultivated when the personal life is cultivated , the family will be regulated when the family is regulated , the state will be in order and when the state is in order , there will be peace throughout the world . from the son of heaven down to the common people , all must regard cultivation of the personal life as the root or foundation . there is never a case when the root is in disorder and yet the branches are in order . there has never been a case when what is treated with great importance becomes a matter of slight importance of what is treated with slight importance becomes a matter of great importance .	c2ofodr	politics

maybe company profits will stop inflating the pockets of ceos , and give their essential labor a better wage , who will in turn spend that money domestically whether that money is spent domestically has no overall effect . more imports just equals more exports in the long run . actually , from a comparison advantage standpoint , more domestic spending would shrink the gdp . either way , that 's going on some odd assumption of yours that labors spend their money domestically , which is obviously is n't true . also , are we in agreement that overall tax would decrease ? i will assume yes since you never addressed that problem . shareholders mean nothing here unless there are dividends , like i said , a companies earnings after tax either goes to dividends or reinvestment . both are consumption . the lesser of these , will equal the greater spending of low wage . hence , no inflation as you guessed . ... and if a shareholder is worried that the company they own stock for can not pay the dividends or even that the stock may crash , they would not hold that stock and stronger companies will go on . i 'm not sure how this relates to what we were talking about . anyway , no inflation which is to be expected in my experience will give the nowearningmore class better buying power ! so now you are expecting no inflation ? thats a 180 degree turn . i thought you said inflation was good . now no inflation is good too ? i 'm getting lost here .	c1qwc1t	politics

i am going to copy and past part of something i wrote in college . it deals with the kellermann paper from the 1993 new england journal of medicine . that 43 number had to be revised down to 2.7 by the time people were done poking holes in his work . the most influential work from the medical field may be gun ownership as a risk factor for homicide in the home . this study led by arthur kellermann claimed that the presence of a firearm in the home made it 2.7 times more likely that someone in that household would be murdered by a firearm . this journal article became one of the most widely cited works dealing with homicide and guns . its conclusion and methods , however , are problematic and misleading . the basis of the study was comparing a sample of households where homicides occurred to supposedly similar control sample . from this comparison the study determined households with guns were more likely to experience homicides . the first problem with this conclusion is that people who are at higher risk for being murdered are more likely to own guns . the presence of the gun does not necessarily change this risk factor . it is very likely that victims high risk lifestyle put them at higher risk for murder , not the ownership of firearms . the victims were also selected from very high risk households . this coupled with a limited number of cases makes a nationwide application of the potential risk factor questionable . nearly all of the homicides in this study were committed with a gun brought by the intruder , not the gun in the home . this indicates the gun is most likely a measure of risk , not a cause of it . finally , the statistics themselves are disputed by gary kleck in can owning a gun really triple the owner 's chances of being murdered ? it seems highly questionable that a paper as rife with criticisms and uncorroborated assumptions should be one of the most widely cited works regarding gun violence . the implication put forth by this paper that a gun in the home increases one s risk for homicide has become so widespread that many people restate this fact without knowing the source and quote it blindly without realizing its problematic basis . and my references arthur kellermann , frederick p. rivara , norman b. rushforth , joyce g. banton , donald t. reay , jerry t. francisco , ana b. locci , janice prodzinski , bela b. hackman , and grant somes , gun ownership as a risk factor for homicide in the home , the new england journal of medicine 329 october , 1993 1084. gary kleck , can owning a gun really triple the owner 's chances of being murdered ? , homicide studies 5 2001 , 65. kleck and kates , armed , 75. kleck and kates , armed , 77. kleck and kates , armed , 75. tl dr kellermann is at best bad at statistics or at worst a liar . edits just the clarify a few things . here is the direct link to the study for those that are interested . URL i would like to also point out this table . URL it is from the link i posted but for the lazy the final conclusion of this survey is a gun in the home is 2.7 more likely to result in a homicide . unfortunately for those who rent , live alone , or smoke pot , all these are much greater risk factors than a gun .	c7y6l42	politics

not the way you describe it . but i see no possible explanation for the iraq war other than private corporations driving wars '' . let 's go over it ? the us government has had a history of freetrade promotion leading to democracies eventually . '' the iraq war could have been revenge for bush 's father . the iraq war could have been an easy target , to send a message to wouldbe dictators that the us is the superpower . they chose iraq because they 've invaded it before and it 's an easy target . the iraq war could have been for freeing up trade in the area . the iraq war could have been establishing another democracy at the doorstep of iran . another strategic base to put pressure on iran . the iraq war could have been incompetent analysis of data . where svr was able to trick western analysts into thinking that saddam and aq were working together . the iraq war could have been about a planned attempt to modernize the middle east and to remove dictatorships and other unfriendly governments from the area . there 's tons of plausible theories that do n't involve corporations . various rich people richer shareholders in big oil , halliburton , et al . , except the fact that the oil fields are now owned by shell and china . so ... it does n't make much sense . even though there was zero evidence that saddam hussein had anything to do with osama bin laden specifically or alqaeda generally yes you are right . but how do you know there was n't a mistake . or how do you know that maybe saddam did work with aq but then stopped completely leading to trails of clues but not enough for anyone to argue publicly that there is a clear link . i remember the day of 911 . on that day , people came up to me and said i bet you it 's saddam . saddam has attacked us . '' this made me wonder . i never even thought of saddam at that moment . but why did so many americans believe saddam had something to do with it . probably because saddam and the us fought before recently , and this may have something to do with it . but it 's pretty clear he had no connection to 911 . so if you think the iraq war or , for that matter , the vietnam war was n't primarily driven by greed , or was n't part of eisenhower 's warning , then i 'd like to hear why you think that . it was n't at all related or driven by greed . iraq war , an argument could be made about it , but there 's no solid evidence . i will often see the same content , word for word , on my local newspaper , on national newspapers , on local news channels , on cable news channels , and online because a lot of sources uses the ap as the official news agency . but some of it is sheer laziness . so you already figured it out . then why are you making complicated conspiracy theories ? that you can explain by incompetence and laziness ? sometimes it 's not sinister plots sometimes it 's just stupidity or laziness . hey have to give the appearance of fairness between both sides of an issue '' you identified another problem . but that 's the problem with journalism , not americans . europeans do the same shit . i cut my teeth on watergate and wondered if all reporters were like woodward and bernstein . sadly , that 's certainly not the case now if it ever was hell , lately , i do n't think woodward and bernstein are like woodward and bernstein were . or maybe you are just more skewed into a radical spectrum than how woodward and bernstein were '' at the time . that just about every political decision on a national level , many or most decisions on a state level , and a startlingly large number of decisions at a countymunicipal level , are made on the basis of greed . but how do you know ? there can be many correlations made between successURL and actions in the past . you ca n't always call them causation '' and imply there was greed motivation involved . sometimes even greedy people do the right thing based on ideology . sometimes ideologues do the wrong thing based on greed . in some cases , even if it was all about greed . what 's the harm ? then someone who has more money should come and fix the situation . plenty of good minded individuals like bill gates or warren buffett exist . why do n't they take advantage like the koch brothers and sheldon adelson ? and if they do n't take advantage out of principle , then maybe they deserve to lose for not being superior in the game of politics . is the same answer deep throat '' gave to woodward and bernstein follow the money . '' sometimes it 's not all about the money . koch brothers are rich , but they do n't do all they do just because of money . they are politically motivated . they have beliefs . beliefs are what motivates everything in the world .	cgj8yyl	politics
until recently i was the qa director for a small educational software shop and i think i have an answer for that because we do n't know . i 've listed jobs and had 12 viable candidates in a week and hired within 2. other times i 've had to ease through dozens of prequalified resumes , done dozens of phone interviews and ended up settling for someone who wasnt great because of project need ... it hurt more to have an empty role and be burning my own time than it did to get someone on board who was not a great fit . so how long a job will run depends on who applies and how fast .	ci2ggh5	politics

i proposed to get money out of politics . you said why bother , let 's go libertarian . now i explained you why getting money out of politics is better than libertarianism . and now you tell me that we have an issue because we have money in politics ? really ? you really did n't . you explained that it can be done . i never really refuted that . i asked why its better to use a state that always reverts back to protecting the oligarchy once you stop looking which people do every time , because they are under the false impression that they can . this entire paragraph is exactly why libertarianism is total bs . it 's the naive idea that collective willpower somehow overcomes the laws of economy that have established over millenia . that somehow , a hivemind will form that will reject morally bad companies even if they make the cheaper offer . you could not say a more ironic thing as someone who supports the use of a compulsory state . any change you want to effect through government happens on a cultural level first . otherwise your push for change flops . government did n't abolish slavery before there was enough of a cultural push to achieve it . women were n't just willy nilly up and granted the right to vote until culture built up enough steam to support it . you are taking a very shallow look at human action , and then calling it ineffective . you are saying a libertarian society wo n't work because people wo n't do the work . ironically , that is exactly why our state is being used against us by the oligarchy . if what you are saying is true , then the state fails on the same grouds that you claim a libertarian society would fail . not even fucking reddit manages to abstain from companies they hate , such as ea or walmart or exxon or bp or boa . try to convince a guy on a minimum wage job to buy great local products instead of skimming cheapskate supermarket chain special offers , do n't even mind when your ideal system got rid of minimum wage and he works for , literally , nothing but board and lodge . are you forgetting the state has been used by these companies extensively ? are you forgetting that the state is being used to prevent us from having viable options ?	cgtb5my	politics

there you go ignoring everything i say and just repeating again . look , that is not how pro life people see the argument . for them , the choice is not important , it the right to life that the fetus has . that 's well and good , but that 's their rationale , not their position . like it or not , their position on the question should one have the choice to legally abort a pregnancy , '' which is the point of disagreement , is no . '' it does n't matter why they feel that way . as i 've said before , rationale and feelings do n't enter into the equation . this is not about why they hold a position . this is about the fact that they hold a position . this it not about feelings . unless you disagree that their answer is no '' to the question do you think one should have the choice to legally abort a pregnancy '' then you agree with me here . because that is my argument . that they would answer no '' to that question . i do n't care about why they answer no , '' just like i do n't care why a prochoicer would answer yes . '' because it 's irrelevant to this discussion . which makes it astounding to me that you somehow think i 'm treating antichoicers unfairly because i 'm holding their position to the same exact standards to which i 'm holding the other side . the only way you can possibly disprove my argument is to argue that they prolifers would answer yes . '' calling them anti choice is framing their argument in a negative light . again , political framing is incompatible with objectivity , so unless you think that they would answer yes '' to that question , again , it is not politically framing their argument . it is an objective representation of their position , which as i 've said about 50 million times , is what i 'm talking about . not their fucking argument . note how many times i 've clarified this . it 's probably upwards of 20 or 30 by now . i 'm not talking about their argument , reason , rationale , or pointofview , because that is not relevant to the question of what their position is , and this entire thing , from the very beginning when i first responded was about position , and only position .	cvazkjf	politics

at first it was lesser of two evils for me . i voted for bernie , and i still love that man . however , after looking into facts on clinton , i do think she would make a good president in theory . listening , in my opinion , is the most important skill a leader can posses . from every account , hillary is an exceptional listener , she even did listening tours with her time in the senate . most of the shit that drips off clinton is shit the right has thrown at her since the '90s . unfortunately , i think that is what is going to lead to her having a rough presidency . similar to australia 's first female prime minister , iirc the media crucified her . i know a lot of us have this feeling that hillary will be able to work with the republicans , but i see no reason for them to stop their obstructionism . it is well documented that they work well together in back rooms , and they paint her as satan in public . who knows , maybe trump snaps them back into reality .	d8j2uj2	politics

the left does n't need someone further left than bernie . imho bernie would give trump a run for his presidency because he speaks loudly , he does n't back down while debating and sticks to his principles . selecting someone further left than him would be a disaster for the dnc because it would isolate the moderateconservative independent voter from the party and give trump way too much ammo to fire up his base . the dems need to run a middle of the road , normal candidate that wo n't get intimidated by mean tweets . hillary made so many mistakes running in 2016. the delete this '' tweet , her lack of response to you 'd be in jail . '' and her general hubris about where to campaign , she abandoned blue collar union states for college campuses on the coast and it cost her the election . dems need someone who will resonate on college campuses and blue collar union states .	ecybm2u	politics
dude you are so smart you caught a russian kgb propaganda spy good job reddit you did it . please report me to fbi . lol it must be rough living a life where wveryone that disagrees with you is a russian spy out to subvert you . lol grow up pal go outside and breath fresh air . it 's ok everyone is n't out to get you . paranoid much ? lol sad have you ever heard of using sarcasm to prove a point ? well you just proved my point ...	dudll81	politics
taxing net worth is going to be impossible . it is just too easy to hide massive amounts of wealth in difficulttoassess assets .	dtf1mut	politics
no , it 's about casey gender was n't sorted out by the time they issued the birth certificate ? cagle being sick and tired of liberals kicking sand in his conservative face and walking off with his girl mom at the beach .	dv3bjmj	politics
when education is a process of finding out how much you do n't know , and dealing with that ... of course the mentally weak are going to viscerally hate it as a concept .	e5wrnee	politics
mueller is n't a politician or elected official . he 's a bureaucrat doing his job . dems have to play dirty if the other side does since it means they are playing by different rules and are at a disadvantage .	e5e0w6f	politics
look if you made a couple million dollars and you did n't give the irs their cut . you 're fucked . manafucked may evade some charges but tax evasion and the subsequent second seperate trial is going to ensure that manafucked is in jail for awhile	e4dc4pg	politics
or , since he 's such an attention whore , maybe send him over to supermax where he 'll be in solitary 23 hours a day ? ignoring him seems to be a fitting punishment .	ebift4a	politics
reason number 1 is your delusion in thinking that american families are all perfect please note where that delusion is displayed in my post last i heard , the us was one of the top producers of child porn what does that have to do with anything ? we 're not a perfect country at all massive projection	dyw1ep4	politics
convicted ? who was convicted ? also , hilarious argument considering how many women have credible accusations trump assaulted them . ivana s deposition of him raping her is fucking harrowing . what a weird hill for you to die on .	e6n9l54	politics
i guess this is why trump was rage tweeting on monday .	dyo1kqv	politics
so you 're at a believesurvivors protest right now then ?	e6k9jnx	politics
agreed , it was ludicrous to stick with hillary just because of party purity when there was a much stronger nominee there in sanders . the centrists are just too naive and emotional about politics to get that they need to put purity aside and accept they wo n't get everything they want .	du0ot1m	politics
someone should make this the new sarcasm font . beats s	e8dbsbq	politics

sinclair broadcasting group if you missed it .	ebbcpbb	politics
why ? gon na get started on that hit list ? i 'm not sure why this is any concern . there 's nothing to the russia investigation , right ? the president himself said it was a total witch hunt .	e1ab1mm	politics
the alternative is immunity for criminals ? in what universe would that ever be good for voters ? trump 's need to be made an example of and the us constitution hardened so this shit never happens again . also since corporations are people in the usa they all need to be held accountable for the destruction of the environment , including political enablers .	ebmp2k9	politics
boi . if they ban tacos , we 're marching on the white house fully armed for revolution .	e14au7j	politics

companies are allowed to set up corporate affiliated pacs . the company is not allowed to use any money from the corporate coffers to fund it , however . instead , it collects money from individual donations by management . pacs are allowed to donate to candidates a maximum amount of money equal to what a married couple could donate .	ea17fb9	politics
from my conversations with a number of them they do n't realize they 're racist . they might not think they are but their support of a president that pushes racist policy ties them to it .	e2fbaxg	politics
the more likely thing is that some kind of allegiance was broken this weekend . i would say getting death threats from people who just a few days ago were on 'his side ' might have been pretty disconcerting .	e70eroi	politics
10 years ago was a totally different world . it was not politically viable to be for gay marriage . obama explicitly ran on civil unions only . no marriage equality . not because he was against it , but because politically it was not a good idea . the healthcare debate likewise was insanely conservative . nobody on either side wanted any serious changes . that 's just the way things were .	ecuokyg	politics
definitely an important point , but the article also mentions that trump has the power to withhold any specific details that he wants . so it 's very possible that he will just ask to exclude any negative results , although i would n't expect to see any outrageous positive statements from this particular doctor . i ca n't stand the asshat , but that is his right under hippa . as much as he chooses to shit on the rest of us , some of us will continue to uphold the moral high ground ... i 'd rather his tax returns than his medical history ...	dscn5n9	politics
this is a fabulous meltdown . thank you , i really needed to see a pede lose their shit today , that was satisfying . also , sickofnazishit did an excellent job tearing your fauxconcern to pieces in this URL comment .	e0vl1qo	politics

it was essentially a two person race and he was the only candidate considered a leftist . there are more choices this time and more nuance to the candidates , so his support might fall away . or it could still be really strong . either way , he ca n't take the 2016 support for granted .	er9gkc0	politics

are you suggesting that fox news is the only news organization that has been lying to people ? i could blow your mind with hundreds of examples of lying from other news media .	ekc8dt0	politics
i think its pretty fair to not count 911 . obviously counting the biggest terrorist attack in our nation 's history is going to skew it towards whoever was responsible for that attack . it wo n't explain how things are trending today . also , i think it 's fair to look at shorter time frames here . the question who is responsible for most terrorism deaths in america for the past 10 years '' seems more relevant to the argument than who is responsible for terrorism deaths in america for the past 50 , 100 , 200 years '' . the data is not mine , but i think it pretty clearly says that white supremacists kill more americans than muslim terrorists . if you 're an american you are more likely to die by the actions of a white supremacist than a muslim terrorist .	f9ocg4s	politics

the company could just rebut and say we treat guns as a public health and safety issue and we did n't make a decision based on anyone 's political views . '' political speech protection is pretty much just your political parties , political party donations , donations made to campaigns , candidates , etc . if you staunchly , absolutely support the elimination of daylight savings time as a political viewpoint nobody cares . you could be discriminated against for that viewpoint . you do n't have a right , or protections , for absolutely everything , just because you can make it a political thing .	eqnd468	politics
