this all looks real enough to me . time to deescalate and try to avoid world war 111 . brig gen hoseyn salami , commander of iran 's revolutionary guards ' air force , said our missiles are ready for shooting at any place and any time , quickly and with accuracy . '' the enemy must not repeat its mistakes . the enemy targets are under surveillance . '' the tests are intended to deter any israeli or us strike against tehran 's nuclear installations , says bbc diplomatic correspondent jonathan marcus . our correspondent who is in israel says the country has a fully operational antiballistic missile system , which israeli military experts believe can counter any iranian threat . but there is no room for complacency , he adds .	c04mu8j	worldpolitics

my knee jerk reaction was 'holy shit , they 're even crazier than the bush admin ! ' then i remembered what happened after 911 , the far right coming out of the wood work , calling on the legalization of torture , advocating mindless war , anne coulter said , and this is more or less a direct quote 'we should invade their countries , kill their leaders and convert them to christianity ' and yes , nuclear explosives came into the discussion . if india follows the path the us did then there 's going to be a lot of shit like torture and pointless wars , hopefully that wo n't happen though . hopefully india will sober up before they do something monumentally stupid like the us did . also as a side note i was browsing through some quotations that came out around the time after 911 and this one from ariel sharon really pissed me off , thought i 'd share we , the jewish people control america , and the americans know it it 's like bin laden with his islam will destroy the west routines , why do these nuts have to tar other people all the time ?	2fyt	worldpolitics

the cold war is over , and yet you apply cold war doctrine . apparently you know that , and i for one , also wish it were true . the fact is that as far as washington and tel aviv are concerned the cold war is not only not over , but is about to become a hot war , with iran as the flash point . i did not specifically reference poland or even the czech republic , but was taking the entire contents of the article into account . always a risky business on reddit i know . i am talking about the entire attempt to encircle russia in a missile shield after prague , dr rice will visit bulgaria and georgia where she will stress us support for tblisi 's application for nato membership , another annoyance for russia . she will also appeal for calm between moscow and tblisi over the separatist georgian regions of abkhazia and south ossetia . '' georgia is an independent state . it has to be treated like one . i want to make very clear that the us commitment to georgia 's territorial integrity is strong . '' include turkey already a long standing member of nato with all of its territory directly south of russia and north of israel and much of the middle east , and my scenario makes perfect sense . the encirclement of russia with these 'defensive missile shields ' can result in only one thing war . i sincerely hope that all parties concerned can pull back from this brink .	c04mvtl	worldpolitics

i agree with most of what you say , and i thank you for posting this response , which is more articulate than what i would have written . upvoted duly . it 's only with your last section that i would take issue . on what might be a nitpicking note , while ethnic persecution was , amongst the tens of millions of people stalin 's regime killed , more of a sideshow , it did persecute groups based on their culture or ethnicity . the extermination of much of the chechen and crimean tatar population could well qualify as genocide , depending on your exact definition . it was an attempted genocide , at least . on your broader point , there is of course something unique about being persecuted for race or ethnicity , which is something you were born with and can not humanly escape . so it 's not quite the same thing when the soviet regime systematically persecuted people on the basis of class , but the mass persecution of socalled kulaks in the early 30s did send hundreds of thousands of people to their death . while in some regions only those who actively resisted collectivization were sent to the camps , in ukraine , for example , there was a more systematic 'decapitation ' of communities where everyone who was educated , owned land , ran shops , or served in church was sent to the camps and much of the remaining peasant population starved in the subsequent terrorfamine '' . triggering the famine and deliberately letting it fester was a strategic move to better subjugate the country , but also followed the model of ideological hatred against the class enemy , and the persecution was specifically antiukrainian enough to be seen as ethnocide '' in its own right . see the work of robert conquest . as for the gulag camps , the brutal cruelty , dehumanization and brainwashing there , especially at the climax of persecution , would not make your skin crawl all that much less . ann applebaum 's gulag documents how the camps were planned , expanded and ran as well as what daytoday life and death in the camps were like in devastating detail , and i had to stop reading halfway through the something like 600 pages because i could not bear it anymore . while there were differences between camps and there were changes over time in what the camps were like , the mass of them were , at least in the late thirties , actual death camps , not just labor or prison camps . there were no ovens , but the prisoners were systematically worked to death , through slave labor in the arctic cold with barely any food or clothing . at some point , it 's true , the profit motive started taking over , and the regime started realizing that it needed the camps to use its free slave labour efficiently rather than just for retribution , which involved at least trying to keep prisoners alive . but by that time millions had died , and millions more would still die regardless . for at least part of the stalinist era and for some groups , like the chechens these were death camps , geared towards extermination . finally i mean , i understand why it 's necessary to make a distinction in the nature of persecution between mass murder that is exclusively fuelled by hatred against a population group , as the holocaust was , and mass murder that was more of a normal '' , powerbased thing that brutal dictatorships engage in . but at some point scale trumps nature . yes , nazi persecution was unique in its character . but when the sheer scale of both nazism and stalinism was unparallelled , and when the gulag , if anything , took tens of millions more lives than the shoah did , this distinction starts losing its salience . in both cases , tens of millions of people were systematically slaughtered because they belonged to the wrong race or the wrong class , lived in the wrong country or had the wrong education , or just because they were one of the millions randomly caught in the machine of terror . if you 're a ukrainian or a lithuanian or a chechen , i can see why it feels wrong that 15 million nazi victims are commemorated in a way that denies 30 million victims of stalin equal billing , so to say .	c0peiqe	worldpolitics

alternet is up in arms about this ? as i see it most of the media has reported that now . what has n't been reported is the ihh 's connections to jihadists and that the israeli soldiers were attacked the moment they set foot on the ship . analysis on the ihh , the organization responsible for the convoy , from the danish institute for international studies a very wellrespected organization URL here the following about ihh is reported on page 10 yet , the phenomenon of charitable front groups that provide support to alqaida is by no means exclusively limited to the arabian peninsula . indeed , elsewhere in the muslim world , other such entities have been established with near equal success as in turkey , with the socalled foundation for human rights , liberties , and humanitarian relief ihh . turkish authorities began their own domestic criminal investigation of ihh as early as december 1997 , when sources revealed that leaders of ihh were purchasing automatic weapons from other regional islamic militant groups.43 ihh s bureau in istanbul was thoroughly searched , and its local officers were arrested . security forces uncovered an array of disturbing items , including firearms , explosives , bombmaking instructions , and a jihad flag. after analyzing seized ihh documents , turkish authorities concluded that detained members of ihh were going to fight in afghanistan , bosnia , and chechnya. according to a french intelligence report , the terrorist infiltration of ihh extended to its most senior ranks . the report , written by famed counterterrorism magistrate jeanlouis bruguiere , revealed that ihh president bulent yildrim had directly conspired in the mid1990s to recruit veteran soldiers in anticipation of the coming holy war jihad . in particular , some men were sent into war zones in muslim countries in order to acquire combat experience. furthermore , in the hopes of obtaining political support from these countries , financial aid was transferred on behalf of ihh , as well as caches of firearms , knives , and prefabricated explosives. an examination of ihh s phone records in istanbul showed repeated telephone calls in 1996 to an alqaida guesthouse in milan and various algerian terrorist operatives active elsewhere in europe including the notorious abu elma ali , who has been subsequently termed by u.s. officials as a junior osama bin laden. during the later seattle trial of wouldbe alqaida millenium bomber ahmed ressam , federal prosecutors called french magistrate bruguiere to the stand as an expert witness . bruguiere testified that ihh had played a n important role in the alqaida millenium bomb plot targeting lax . under repeated questioning , bruguiere insisted that t here s a rather close relation and there 's more of ihh 's dubious activities in the report . here is footage of the convoy leaving port while singing khaybar , khaybar , oh jews ! the army of mohammed will return !

yo captain america , stress positions and sleep or sensory deprivation are by definition torture . that 's not good copbad cop , that 's asking nicely and then causing physical and mental harm if you do n't get what you want . it does n't really matter if you change what you call it , the effects are still the same . wiki the consequences of torture reach far beyond immediate pain . many victims suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd , which includes symptoms such as flashbacks or intrusive thoughts , severe anxiety , insomnia , nightmares , depression and memory lapses . torture victims often feel guilt and shame , triggered by the humiliation they have endured . many feel that they have betrayed themselves or their friends and family . all such symptoms are normal human responses to abnormal and inhuman treatment . for survivors , torture often leads to lasting mental and physical health problems . physical problems can be wideranging , e.g . sexually transmitted diseases , musculoskeletal problems , brain injury , posttraumatic epilepsy and dementia or chronic pain syndromes . mental health problems are equally wideranging common are posttraumatic stress disorder , depression and anxiety disorder . psychic deadness , erasure of intersubjectivity , refusal of meaningmaking , perversion of agency , and an inability to bear desire constitute the core features of the posttraumatic psychic landscape of torture . i wonder how real psychologists think about your bad copshit . good of them to tell us on august 19 , 2007 , the american psychology association apa voted to bar participation , to intervene to stop , and to report involvement in a wide variety of interrogation techniques as torture , including using mock executions , simulated drowning , sexual and religious humiliation , stress positions or sleep deprivation '' , as well as the exploitation of prisoners ' phobias , the use of mindaltering drugs , hooding , forced nakedness , the use of dogs to frighten detainees , exposing prisoners to extreme heat and cold , physical assault and threatening the use of such techniques against a prisoner or a prisoner 's family .

one of gaddafis goal was to get rid of the saudi monarchy . no secret . gaddafi relationship with islam is interesting . but the gaddafi legacy is over so really no use talking about him . the thing with gaddafi was he suppressed any opposition to him . that include religious leaders , unions , institutions , academics , etc . the thing is libya is a very traditional conservative society . way more traditional and conservative than her neighbors tunisia and egypt . imho it is impossible for islam to become less important in the lives of libyans . maybe i am wrong but i dont think so . libya is such a traditional society . sharia law will be the basis of libya . and that is what the people want . and the reason is simple libya is a conservative islamic group of people forming a very traditional tribal society . but take a look at the neighbors of libya . tunisia and egypt . both countries imho will not have a sharia legal system . the reasons are many but basically they are not as traditional i know this is not the best word to use but i cant think of any other term . the real problem with wahabis and why wahabis fail to export their version of islam is wahabis are against culture . they do not believe in preserving culture at all . look at the historical sites of saudi arabia . they are basically all gone . the wahabis just bulldozed them over . for wahabis cultural landmarks are signs of worshiping idols . wahabiism is just not compatible in most places . for example if some guy in libya is a religious and pious muslim . he will have very strong feelings toward his land and his family system and his familytribal history . the thing is wahabis are against that . so in a sense wahabiism is not compatible with the vast majority of muslims outside of saudi arabia and a few gulf coop states like kuwait . one thing i would like to clear up . because i feel reddit does not understand libyans . libyans are the hardest working , most clever , toughest , baddest , sons of bitches , this side of neptune . no and i mean no one is going to tell them what to do . no one is going to take them over and take advantage of them . libya is a country of 6 million gaddafis . i know the popular image of libya on reddit is a nation that is going to be used up by nato forces but that is so wrong . saudi would love to oppress libya because libya is now a threat at becoming a real regional superpower . but they can not . libya is an insanely wealthy country , with a very small population and her people are tough as nails . saudi arabia has a lot of problems and is basically buying time with high oil prices .	c2upxu0	worldpolitics

look , what obama states '' or does n't state is n't really relevant . i 'm well aware that his rhetoric is , at times , pretty liberal but that does n't change the fact that his actual policy is very much conservative . and the usual excuse that it 's the big bad republicans in congress that are keeping obama from being the true liberal he really is does n't pass the reality check , considering that for the first two years , he had a majority in house and was one vote short of having a supermajority in senate . republicans were able to pass very controversal legislation with far less support the famous temporary '' tax cut on the rich , which reduced top marginal tax rate to 35 from 39.6 , and , even more importantly , also reduced the capital gains rate from 20 to 15 effectively cutting taxes on the very rich , for whom the majority of income comes from capital gains , by a third , was passed 5050 in senate URL , so the idea that democrats could not pass an actual liberal health care reform while having 59 votes is ludicrous . that does n't even consider actions that obama took fully by himself , without any need of congress approval and many of such actions still show very firm conservative values . examples are plenty from his appointment of a former monsanto exec to supervise food safety in fda , to the everescalating wars in the middle east , to dealed marijuana raids , even in states with medical marijuana regulations URL , to the increasing amounts of deportations of illegal aliens with clean records all of those are actions obama is performing by himself , and all of them unmistakably point to his actual corporate roots , rather than the cute liberal rhetorics that 's so effective in winning the minds and the votes of liberals who just want to believe there 's finally their '' guy in power . i want to believe , too . but facts are clear .	c6xentz	worldpolitics

i tend to agree with your impressions and conclusions , but the situation is a bit more complex . if you ask the israelis if they want peace , the overwhelming response will be yes '' . if you ask them if they are willing to make deep concessions '' for peace , they will also , most likely , say they are . now , if you start to investigate what those deep concessions are , you will see that , for the most part , they are not willing to give the palestinians sovereignty , control over water and air , nor all of the opt . imo , you will not get a majority in israel for giving the palestinians more than a noncontiguous 60 or so of the west bank if that , they will insist on retaining most of the settler population , no concessions on arab jerusalem , control over the land borders with jordan , control of airspace and water . they will also insist on demilitarization and recognition of israel as the nationstate of the jewish people '' whatever the hell that means . as for the right of return no fucking way . all of this is , quite obviously , completely unacceptable to the international community or the palestinians . in other words , the israelis want peace '' but are not willing to offer anywhere near the kind of deal that the palestinians would agree to . at the same time , they continue to grow the settlements and make the territory that they can negotiate for smaller every day . stated differently the israelis are only willing to say they want peace , with conviction . it will take rivers of blood for them to understand that they need to get serious and make an acceptable offer .	c5wzlp5	worldpolitics

good points . i am no expert in this , but i think the fundamental factor is the fear of being ridiculed . and when do you most run the greatest risk of being ridiculed ? it is when you speak out against the consensus , when you stand out , when you attract attention to yourself . this politico article is a perfect example the media in general does not address this , and most people get all their information from the mainstream media . therefore any mention of it will place you outside of the accepted framework or space within which we debate . the line is being blurred between being a critical observer and a conspiracy theorist , and as a result people are willing to ignore certain facts for fear of being ostracised . lastly , i think its in part due to the fact that wouldbe critics of israel are afraid of being painted as antisemites . this is especially true given the fact that the criticism revolves around israelis influencing the government through campaign donations i.e . money , and therefore can be easily distorted into an argument that plays on the stereotype that jews have a lot of money . what do you think ?	cfv1aaw	worldpolitics

paywall domestic critics and the international community have for years pilloried israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu for supporting israeli settlements settlements that are entrenching an israeli occupation in the west bank and east jerusalem that is widely viewed , by nearly everyone except the israeli rightwing , as the root cause of the growing violence plaguing israelis today . netanyahu , of course , has a very different explanation for the violence antisemitism and incitement , and nothing else , especially not the occupation nor the settlements . to bolster his case , netanyahu , who has for decades positioned himself publicly as a champion of the settlers most recently boasting to a likud audience that settler numbers had increased by 120,000 since his taking office in 2009 , last week tried to turn the tables on the critics , claiming that settlements can not be the cause of violence , since their growth has actually slowed during his time in office , compared to his predecessors . he probably based this claim on a statistic highlighted in a report in haaretz , according to which the average number of new housing units built in settlements in the west bank per year since 2009 has been lower than during the preceding 20 years . but beware a single statistic taken in isolation always obscures far more than it reveals . so has settlement growth really slowed under netanyahu ? to begin with , the statistic on new housing starts ignores east jerusalem , an area in which for the past six years settlement construction has been at its highest annual level since 2000. much of this construction alters potential future borders , in significant ways , between israel and palestine a new settlement called givat hamatos , approved under netanyahu but not yet constructed , could be a potent dealbreaker . likewise , netanyahu has outdone his recent predecessors with respect to settlement activity in the heart of east jerusalem s palestinian neighborhoods . virtually from the moment he took office , with the 2009 approval of a new settlement in sheikh jarrah , through last week s settler takeover in silwan , under netanyahu the settler enterprise in these volatile areas has boomed . another problem is methodological . netanyahu has been prime minister for longer than anyone since the legendary david ben gurion . comparing only two out of his three full terms in office is misleading . if we compare his entire time in office , including the 1990 's , or if we compare his last tenure alone to the other tenures in recent years , netanyahu has built more in settlements than any of his recent predecessors except for ehud barak in 2000 . the exception was no surprise his second term 20092012 , notable for the obama administration s 2009 settlementfocused peace efforts and the subsequent 2010 10month moratorium , during which netanyahu agreed to hold off on new settlement planning and approvals . in contrast , during netanyahu s 20132015 term , new construction starts in west bank settlements have spiked , reaching a higher level than under any government since 2000. this spike was driven by a surge in planning and tenders following the end of the moratorium , and by the kerryled 2013 peace effort , which was accompanied every step of the way by new settlement announcements and approvals . based on data for the first half of this year , and barring a deliberate slowdown , this trend can be expected to continue in 2015. the statistic also omits key data about new settlement construction . according to peace now research , between 2009 and 2014 settlers built more than 1000 new units illegally phantom units uncounted by the israeli central bureau of statistics , some of which netanyahu subsequently legalized . and under netanyahu , new construction starts in settlements located east of the route of israel s separation barrier , in settlements that nobody believes could become part of israel under a negotiated deal , increased from around 20 to 35 of the total , according to peace now data . finally , the statistic says nothing about support for settlements unrelated to construction starts , for instance the investment in the process before building begins . netanyahu has advanced planning for more than 18,000 new units in west bank settlements almost half to be built east of the barrier , and more than 12,000 units in east jerusalem , based on peace now research . how long it takes for a plan to be approved and for building work to start depends very much on the government s eagerness it can vary between a few months and many years . netanyahu approved a new settlement in hebron , in a large palestinian structure taken over by settlers . netanyahu has confiscated large swathes of the west bank , including 490 acres to facilitate the legalization of outposts and 990 acres to benefit the etzion settlement bloc , a confiscation unprecedented in scope since the 1980 's . netanyahu has also built major new infrastructure to serve settlements , including a highway to give settlers living south of jerusalem direct access to the city s center , routed through the middle of a palestinian neighborhood of jerusalem , and an interchange southeast of ramallah , to facilitate travel for settlers living in the west bank heartland . and netanyahu is actively working to push palestinians out of area c the area of the west bank under full israeli control and home to most settlements via home demolitions , actual and threatened , and coercive displacement targeting , most notably , the village of sussia and bedouins living in the jordan valley and in the area planned for the settlement of e1 . statistics can help track specific aspects of israel settlement policy , but like any statistics , when cherrypicked they obscure more than they reveal . in this case , a single statistic is being exploited to obscure netanyahu s track record of relentlessly promoting settlements . the totality of the facts tells the real story a story of a long history of deep and active support for settlement expansion , checked only intermittently and temporarily , for tactical political purposes .	cwnxk7b	worldpolitics

'' the best estimates of the average insurance company net profit margin are between 3 and 8 , with a likely median average around 4 to 5 . '' URL that 's not exactly high , and the fact that the profit margins are so low compared to how many years in a row that medical costs have risen suggests they are n't the smoking gun for rising costs . the reason prices are so high is because there exists a huge gap between healthcare supply and demand . that 's it , it 's all that simple . we can either encourage an increase in supply by reducing all the costs , time , and restricting regulations associated with becoming a medical provider , or we ration supply . everything from trumpcare to single payer only rations the supply in different ways . imagine if we doubled the number of doctors , hospitals , and health clinics in this country . that would actually be better for everyone , except maybe healthcare providers who would have to compete much more for customers . increasing supply always helps the consumer , why would we never talk about the supply side of healthcare ? oh yeah , because the ama and the insurance companies all benefit from restricting supply and they 're the ones who write the laws .	df6ina2	worldpolitics

i was n't comparing wages to other countries , just other online stores in the us , which you say would be paying better . not really sure what point you 're trying to make about employees generating growth for the company while besoz isnt . if he didnt create the company they would n't have a job at amazon . unless you think that all minimumwage employees should be paid more ? which just causes the costs of everything else to rise with it . the 2 graphs do n't really tell me much , and you did n't really give much context . also just comparing wages between the uk and us does n't account for a lot of other benefits employees here receive . you act like it 's a crime that better jobs pay more , even though most minimum wage jobs often require no talent , expertise , or education to perform . also another reason these jobs pay less is because government assistance exists . remove the assistance and the pay will naturally rise to compensate . as soon as government comes in and starts dictating minimum wages and or government assistance the free market will adjust to compensate . and at the end of the day amazon is employing more people than other online stores . which means less poverty and more growth for everyone . why do think so many states were bidding like crazy for the second amazon has ? because they know having amzon in their state will lower unemployment and bring growth .	ekdgz3l	worldpolitics
