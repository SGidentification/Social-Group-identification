thanks for the thoughtful reply . in terms of violence , i did not mean there was any violence taking place in individual businesses , although to ignore the violent history of labour rights in the u.s. and indeed the world is a huge mistake . there have indeed been many people killed , oppressed , and subjected to government violence in attempts to democratize the state capitalist system . reading about the labour movement 's history in the u.s. would illustrate that immediately . i agree with you about mutual labour contracts , and the employer and employee relationship being legitimate , but the major form of oppression comes from the lack of options . if you want to join a business for instance in it , the only option is to join an authoritarian run business . there are no or very few it coops , so a person wanting to apply their trade must either create their own business and absorb the value of their employee 's labour , or have their own labour value absorbed by their boss . because of all of the advantages running an authoritarian business has in the government and law , even people wanting to create a more democratic business have very little leeway to do so . tax breaks , subsidies , and regulations all favour authoritarian business . there is no democracy in business . it is currently structured in an authoritarian manner and this damages our freedoms and it hinders the spread of liberty . i also appreciate many of the similarities between right and left wing libertarians and i think we have more in common than most would have us believe . we may not agree on how to structure our society in terms of positive rights for individuals health , education , welfare , etc , but we can all agree that the system we have now is not fair , not free , and by including more options and removing many of the state capitalist barriers that the government props up , we can have a more free society . we can argue over the right to health and education after we have together reduced much of the undue power state capitalism has achieved .	clohxev	Libertarian	2014	thanks for the thoughtful reply . in terms of violence , i did not mean there
