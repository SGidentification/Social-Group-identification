at least . on your broader point , there is of course something unique about being persecuted for race or ethnicity , which is something you were born with and can not humanly escape . so it 's not quite the same thing when the soviet regime systematically persecuted people on the basis of class , but the mass persecution of socalled kulaks in the early 30s did send hundreds of thousands of people to their death . while in some regions only those who actively resisted collectivization were sent to the camps , in ukraine , for example , there was a more systematic 'decapitation ' of

. triggering the famine and deliberately letting it fester was a strategic move to better subjugate the country , but also followed the model of ideological hatred against the class enemy , and the persecution was specifically antiukrainian enough to be seen as ethnocide '' in its own right . see the work of robert conquest . as for the gulag camps , the brutal cruelty , dehumanization and brainwashing there , especially at the climax of persecution , would not make your skin crawl all that much less . ann applebaum 's gulag documents how the camps were planned , expanded and ran as well as what daytoday life and death in the camps were like in devastating detail , and i had to stop reading halfway through the something like 600 pages because i could not bear it anymore . while there were differences between camps and there were changes over time in what the camps were like , the mass of them were , at least in the late thirties , actual death camps , not just labor or prison camps . there were no ovens , but the prisoners were systematically worked to death , through slave labor in the arctic cold with barely any food or clothing . at some point , it 's true , the profit motive started taking over , and the regime started realizing that it needed the camps to use its free slave labour efficiently rather than just for retribution , which involved at least trying

one of gaddafis goal was to get rid of the saudi monarchy . no secret . gaddafi relationship with islam is interesting . but the gaddafi legacy is over so really no use talking about him . the thing with gaddafi was he suppressed any opposition to him . that include religious leaders , unions , institutions , academics , etc . the thing is libya is a very traditional conservative society . way more traditional and conservative than her neighbors tunisia and egypt . imho it is impossible for islam to become less important in the lives of libyans . maybe i am wrong but i dont think so . libya is such a traditional society . sharia law will be the basis of libya . and that is what the people want . and the reason is simple libya is a conservative islamic group of people forming a very traditional tribal society . but take a look at the neighbors of libya . tunisia and egypt . both countries imho will not have a sharia legal system . the reasons are many but basically they are not as traditional i know this is not the best word to use but i cant think of any other term . the real problem with wahabis and why wahabis fail to export their version of islam is wahabis are against culture . they do not believe in preserving culture at all . look at the historical sites of saudi arabia . they are basically all gone . the wahabis just bulldozed them over . for wahabis cultural landmarks are signs of worshiping idols . wahabiism is just not compatible in most places . for example if some guy in libya is a religious and pious muslim . he will have very strong feelings toward his land and his family system and his familytribal history . the thing is wahabis are against that . so in a sense wahabiism is not compatible with the vast majority of muslims outside of saudi arabia and a few gulf coop states like kuwait . one thing i would like to clear up . because i feel reddit does not understand libyans . libyans are the hardest working , most clever , toughest , baddest , sons of bitches , this side of neptune . no and i mean no one is going to tell them what to do . no one is going to take them over and take advantage of them . libya is a country of 6 million gaddafis . i know the popular image of libya on reddit is a nation that is going to be used up by nato forces but that is so wrong . saudi would love to oppress libya because libya is now a threat at becoming a real regional superpower . but they can not . libya is an insanely wealthy country , with a very small population and her people are tough as nails . saudi arabia has a lot of

i tend to agree with your impressions and conclusions , but the situation is a bit more complex . if you ask the israelis if they want peace , the overwhelming response will be yes '' . if you ask them if they are willing to make deep concessions '' for peace , they will also , most likely , say they are . now , if you start to investigate what those deep concessions are , you will see that , for the most part , they are not willing to give the palestinians sovereignty , control over water and air , nor all of the opt . imo , you will not get a majority in israel for giving the palestinians more than a noncontiguous 60 or so of the west bank if that , they will insist on retaining most of the settler population , no concessions on arab jerusalem , control over the land borders with jordan , control of airspace and water . they will also insist on demilitarization and recognition of israel as the nationstate of the jewish people '' whatever the hell that means . as for the right of return no fucking way . all of this is , quite obviously , completely unacceptable to the international community or the palestinians . in other words , the israelis want peace '' but

paywall domestic critics and the international community have for years pilloried israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu for supporting israeli settlements settlements that are entrenching an israeli occupation in the west bank and east jerusalem that is widely viewed , by nearly everyone except the israeli rightwing , as the root cause of the growing violence plaguing israelis today . netanyahu , of course , has a very different explanation for the violence antisemitism and incitement , and nothing else , especially not the occupation nor the settlements . to bolster his case , netanyahu , who has for decades positioned himself publicly as a champion of the settlers most recently boasting to a likud audience that settler numbers had increased by 120,000 since his taking office in 2009 , last week tried to turn the tables on the critics , claiming that settlements can not be the cause of violence , since their growth has actually slowed during his time in office , compared to his predecessors . he probably based this claim on a statistic highlighted in a report in haaretz , according to which the average number of new housing units built in settlements in the west bank per year since 2009 has been lower than during the preceding 20 years . but beware a single statistic taken in isolation always obscures far more than it reveals . so has settlement growth really slowed under netanyahu ? to begin with , the statistic on new housing starts ignores east jerusalem , an area in which for the past six years settlement construction has been at its highest annual level since 2000. much of this construction alters potential future borders , in significant ways , between israel and palestine a new settlement called givat hamatos , approved under netanyahu but not yet constructed , could be a potent dealbreaker . likewise , netanyahu has outdone his recent predecessors with respect to settlement activity in the heart of east jerusalem s palestinian neighborhoods . virtually from the moment he took office , with the 2009 approval of a new settlement in sheikh jarrah , through last week s settler takeover in silwan , under netanyahu the settler enterprise in these volatile areas has boomed . another problem is methodological . netanyahu has been prime minister for longer than anyone since the legendary david ben gurion . comparing only two out of his three full terms in office is misleading . if we compare his entire time in office , including the 1990 's , or if we compare his last tenure alone to the other tenures in recent years , netanyahu has built more in settlements than any of his recent predecessors except for ehud barak in 2000 . the exception was no surprise his second term 20092012 , notable for the obama administration s 2009 settlementfocused peace efforts and the subsequent 2010 10month moratorium , during which netanyahu agreed to hold off on new settlement planning and approvals . in contrast , during netanyahu s 20132015 term , new construction starts in west bank settlements have spiked , reaching a higher level than under any government since 2000. this spike was driven by a surge in planning and tenders following the end of the moratorium , and by the kerryled 2013 peace effort , which was accompanied every step of the way by new settlement announcements and approvals . based on data for the first half of this year , and barring a deliberate slowdown , this trend can be expected to continue in 2015. the statistic also omits key data about new settlement construction . according to peace now research , between 2009 and 2014 settlers built more than 1000 new units illegally phantom units uncounted by the israeli central bureau of statistics , some of which netanyahu subsequently legalized . and under netanyahu , new construction starts in settlements located east of the route of israel s separation barrier , in settlements that nobody believes could become part of israel under a negotiated deal , increased from around 20 to 35 of the total , according to peace now data . finally , the statistic says nothing about support for settlements unrelated to construction starts , for instance the investment in the process before building begins . netanyahu has advanced planning for more than 18,000 new units in west bank settlements almost half to be built east of the barrier , and more than 12,000 units in east jerusalem , based on peace now research . how long it takes for a plan to be approved and for building work to start depends very much on the government s eagerness it can vary between a few months and many years . netanyahu approved a new settlement in hebron , in a large palestinian structure taken over by settlers . netanyahu has confiscated large swathes of the west bank , including 490 acres to facilitate the legalization of outposts and 990 acres to benefit the etzion settlement bloc , a confiscation unprecedented in scope since the 1980 's . netanyahu has also built major new infrastructure to serve settlements , including a highway to give settlers living south of jerusalem direct access to the city s center , routed through the middle of a palestinian neighborhood of jerusalem , and an interchange southeast of ramallah , to facilitate travel for settlers living in the west bank heartland . and netanyahu is actively working to push palestinians out of area c the area of the west bank under full israeli control and home to most settlements via home demolitions , actual and threatened , and coercive displacement targeting , most notably , the village of sussia and bedouins living in the jordan valley and in the area planned for the settlement of e1 . statistics can help track specific aspects of israel settlement policy , but like any statistics , when cherrypicked they obscure more than they reveal . in this case , a single statistic is being exploited to obscure netanyahu s track record of relentlessly promoting settlements . the totality of the facts tells the real story a story of a long history of deep and active support for settlement expansion , checked only intermittently and temporarily , for tactical political purposes .	cwnxk7b	worldpolitics	2015	paywall domestic critics and the international community have for years pilloried israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu
