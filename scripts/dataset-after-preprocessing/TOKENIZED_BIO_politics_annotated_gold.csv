i will assume yes since you never addressed that problem . @@shareholders## mean nothing here unless there are dividends , like i said , a companies earnings after tax either goes to dividends or reinvestment . both are consumption . the lesser of these , will equal the greater spending of low wage . hence , no inflation as you guessed . ... and if a shareholder is worried that the company they own stock for can not pay the dividends or even that the stock may crash , they would not hold that stock and stronger companies will go on . i 'm not sure how this relates to what we were talking about . anyway , no inflation which is to be expected in my experience will give @@the nowearningmore class## better buying power ! so now you are expecting no inflation ? thats a 180 degree turn . i thought you said inflation was good . now no inflation is good too ? i 'm getting lost here .
